        <string name="preface_body">THE present translation of the Exercises of St. Ignatius has been made from the Spanish Autograph of St. Ignatius.
        The copy so designated is not indeed in the handwriting of the Saint, but has a good number of corrections made by him and is
        known to have been used by him in giving the Exercises. St. Ignatius of Loyola was a man without any great pretensions
        to education at the time he wrote this book. His native language was not Spanish, but Basque. His lack of education
        and his imperfect acquaintance with pure Spanish are enough to make it clear that a refined use of any language,
        and more especially of the Spanish, or, in general, anything like a finished or even perfectly correct, style
        is not to be expected in his work. Literary defects he removed to some extent, perhaps, as he continued to use
        and apply the book, but he is known never to have been fearful of such faults. His corrections found in this
        text are clearly made with a view to precision more than to anything else. The Autograph of St. Ignatius was
        translated by Father General Roothaan into Latin and was reproduced by Father Rodeles in his edition of the Spanish text.
        But the original was not available to ordinary students. In 1908, however, Father General Wernz allowed the entire book
        to be phototyped, and in this way it was spread throughout the Society of Jesus in a large number of copies.
        It is one of these which has been chiefly employed by the present translator, who has, besides, made frequent
        use of the Manuscript itself. After considerable study of the matter, it seemed best to make this translation as
        faithful and close a reproduction of the Spanish text as could be. To do so it was necessary at times to sacrifice
        the niceties of style, but it was thought that those who would use the book would easily forego the elegancies of
        diction if they could feel sure they were reading the very words of St. Ignatius. Any other form of translation
        than the one adopted could hardly be kept from being a partial expansion, illustration or development of the original,
        and would therefore have proved, to some extent, a commentary as well as a translation. This the translator has earnestly sought to avoid,
        preferring to leave the further work of commentary to another occasion or to other hands. Another reason for aiming at
        absolute fidelity rather than style was the fact that the Exercises are mostly read, not continuously for any time,
        but piecemeal and meditatively. Literary finish would therefore not be much sought or cared for in the book, but accuracy is.
        For this a certain neglect of style seemed pardonable in the translation, if only the real meaning of the writer could be made clear.
        Perhaps some may even find a charm in the consequent want of finish, seeing it reproduces more completely the style of St. Ignatius.
        The process of translating in this way the Autograph text is not as simple as it might seem. The first difficulty is to make sure of
        the exact meaning of St. Ignatius. This is obscured, at times, by his language being that of nearly 400 years ago and being not pure
        Spanish. Occasionally, in fact, the Saint makes new Spanish words from the Latin or Italian, or uses Spanish words in an Italian or
        Latin sense, or employs phrases not current except in the Schools, and sometimes even has recourse to words in their Latin form.
        To be sure, then, of the meaning, one must often go to other languages and to the terms adopted in Scholastic Philosophy or Theology.
        The meaning clear, the further difficulty comes of finding an exactly equivalent English word or phrase.</string>

        Man is created to praise, reverence, and serve God our Lord, and by this means to save his soul.
        And the other things on the face of the earth are created for man and that they may help him in prosecuting the end for which he is created.\n
        From this it follows that man is to use them as much as they help him on to his end, and ought to rid himself
        of them so far as they hinder him as to it.\n
        For this it is necessary to make ourselves indifferent to all created things in all that is allowed to the choice of
        our free will and is not prohibited to it;
        so that, on our part, we want not health rather than sickness, riches rather than poverty, honor rather than dishonor,
        long rather than short life, and so in all the rest; desiring and choosing only what is most conducive for us to the end
        for which we are created.\n</string>

        <string name="spe_particular_and_daily_examen">
        It contains in it three times, and two to examine oneself.\n
        The first time is in the morning, immediately on rising, when one ought to propose to guard himself with diligence against
        that particular sin or defect which he wants to correct and amend.\n
        The second time is after dinner, when one is to ask of God our Lord what one wants, namely, grace to remember how many times
        he has fallen into that particular sin or defect, and to amend himself in the future. Then let him make the first Examen, asking
        account of his soul of that particular thing proposed, which he wants to correct and amend. Let him go over hour by hour,
        or period by period, commencing at the hour he rose, and continuing up to the hour and instant of the present examen, and let
        him make in the first line of the G———- as many dots as were the times he has fallen into that particular sin or defect.
        Then let him resolve anew to amend himself up to the second Examen which he will make.\n
        The third time: After supper, the second Examen will be made, in the same way, hour by hour, commencing at
        the first Examen and continuing up to the present (second) one, and let him make in the second
        line of the same G———- as many dots as were the times he has fallen into that particular sin or defect.\n</string>

        <string name="spe_four_additions">
        <p><b>First Addition.</b> The first Addition is that each time one falls into that particular sin or defect, let him put his hand on his breast, grieving for having fallen: which can be done even in the presence of many, without their perceiving what he is doing.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Addition.</b> The second: As the first line of the G———- means the first Examen, and the second line the second Examen, let him look at night if there is amendment from the first line to the second, that is, from the first Examen to the second.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Addition.</b> The third: To compare the second day with the first; that is, the two Examens of the present day with the other two Examens of the previous day, and see if he has amended himself from one day to the other.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Addition.</b> The fourth Addition: To compare one week with another, and see if he has amended himself in the present week over the week past.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> It is to be noted that the first (large) G———- which follows means the Sunday: the second (smaller), the Monday: the third, the Tuesday, and so on.</p>\n G\n G\n G\n G\n G\n G\n</string>
        <string name="spe_gen_examen_of_conscience_content_one">I presuppose that there are three kinds of thoughts in me: that is, one my own, which springs from my mere liberty and will; and two others, which come from without, one from the good spirit, and the other from the bad.</string>
        <string name="spe_gen_examen_of_conscience_content_two">
        There are two ways of meriting in the bad thought which comes from without, namely:\n
        <b>First Way.</b> A thought of committing a mortal sin, which thought I resist immediately and it
remains conquered.\n
        <b>Second Way.</b> The second way of meriting is: When that same bad thought comes to me and I
resist it, and it returns to me again and again, and I always resist, until it is conquered.\n
        <p>This second way is more meritorious than the first.\n</p>
        <p>A venial sin is committed when the same thought comes of sinning mortally and one gives ear
to it, making some little delay, or receiving some sensual pleasure, or when there is some negligence
            in rejecting such thought.</p>\n
        <p>There are two ways of sinning mortally:</p>\n
        <p><b>First Way.</b> The first is, when one gives consent to the bad thought, to act afterwards as he has
consented, or to put it in act if he could.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Way.</b> The second way of sinning mortally is when that sin is put in act.</p>\n
        <p>This is a greater sin for three reasons: first, because of the greater time; second, because of the
greater intensity; third, because of the greater harm to the two persons.</p>\n

        <string name="spe_gen_examen_of_conscience_content_three">
        One must not swear, either by Creator or creature, if it be not with truth, necessity and reverence.\n
        By necessity I mean, not when any truth whatever is affirmed with oath, but when it is of some
importance for the good of the soul, or the body, or for temporal goods.\n
        By reverence I mean when, in naming the Creator and Lord, one acts with consideration, so as
to render Him the honor and reverence due.\n
        It is to be noted that, though in an idle oath one sins more when he swears by the Creator than
by the creature, it is more difficult to swear in the right way with truth, necessity and reverence by
the creature than by the Creator, for the following reasons.\n
        <b>First Reason.</b> The first: When we want to swear by some creature, wanting to name the creature
does not make us so attentive or circumspect as to telling the truth, or as to affirming it with necessity,
as would wanting to name the Lord and Creator of all things.\n
        <b>Second Reason.</b> The second is that in swearing by the creature it is not so easy to show reverence
and respect to the Creator, as in swearing and naming the same Creator and Lord, because wanting
to name God our Lord brings with it more respect and reverence than wanting to name the created
thing. Therefore swearing by the creature is more allowable to the perfect than to the imperfect,
because the perfect, through continued contemplation and enlightenment of intellect, consider,
meditate and contemplate more that God our Lord is in every creature, according to His own essence,
presence and power, and so in swearing by the creature they are more apt and prepared than the
imperfect to show respect and reverence to their Creator and Lord.\n
        <b>Third Reason.</b> The third is that in continually swearing by the creature, idolatry is to be more
feared in the imperfect than in the perfect.\n
        <p>One must not speak an idle word. By idle word I mean one which does not benefit either me
or another, and is not directed to that intention. Hence words spoken for any useful purpose, or
meant to profit one’s own or another’s soul, the body or temporal goods, are never idle, not even
if one were to speak of something foreign to one’s state of life, as, for instance, if a religious speaks
of wars or articles of trade; but in all that is said there is merit in directing well, and sin in directing
badly, or in speaking idly.</p>\n
<p>Nothing must be said to injure another’s character or to find fault, because if I reveal a mortal
sin that is not public, I sin mortally; if a venial sin, venially; and if a defect, I show a defect of my
own.</p>\n
        <p>But if the intention is right, in two ways one can speak of the sin or fault of another:</p>\n
        <b>First Way.</b> The first: When the sin is public, as in the case of a public prostitute, and of a
sentence given in judgment, or of a public error which is infecting the souls with whom one comes
in contact.\n
        <b>Second Way.</b> Second: When the hidden sin is revealed to some person that he may help to raise
him who is in sin—supposing, however, that he has some probable conjectures or grounds for
thinking that he will be able to help him./n

         <p>Taking the Ten Commandments, the Precepts of the Church and the recommendations of
Superiors, every act done against any of these three heads is, according to its greater or less nature,
a greater or a lesser sin.</p>\n
        <p>By recommendations of Superiors I mean such things as Bulls de Cruzadas and other
Indulgences, as for instance for peace, granted under condition of going to Confession and receiving
the Blessed Sacrament. For one commits no little sin in being the cause of others acting contrary
to such pious exhortations and recommendations of our Superiors, or in doing so oneself.</p>\n

        <p>Examen, hour by hour, or period by period: and first as to thoughts, and then as to words, and then
as to acts, in the same order as was mentioned in the Particular Examen.</p>\n
        <b>Fourth Point.</b> The fourth, to ask pardon of God our Lord for the faults.\n

        <string name="spe_gen_conf_with_communion_content">
        Whoever, of his own accord, wants to make a General Confession, will, among many other advantages, find three in making it here.\n
        <b>First.</b> The first: Though whoever goes to Confession every year is not obliged to make a General
Confession, by making it there is greater profit and merit, because of the greater actual sorrow for
all the sins and wickedness of his whole life.\n
        <b>Second.</b> The second: In the Spiritual Exercises, sins and their malice are understood more
intimately, than in the time when one was not so giving himself to interior things. Gaining now
more knowledge of and sorrow for them, he will have greater profit and merit than he had before.\n
        <b>Third.</b> The third is: In consequence, having made a better Confession and being better disposed,
one finds himself in condition and prepared to receive the Blessed Sacrament: the reception of
which is an aid not only not to fall into sin, but also to preserve the increase of grace.\n
        <p>This General Confession will be best made immediately after the Exercises of the First Week.</p>\n
    </string>
        <string name="spe_first_exercise_content">
        It contains in it, after one Preparatory Prayer and two Preludes, three chief Points and one Colloquy.\n
        <b>Prayer.</b> The Preparatory Prayer is to ask grace of God our Lord that all my intentions, actions
and operations may be directed purely to the service and praise of His Divine Majesty.\n
        <b>First Prelude.</b> The First Prelude is a composition, seeing the place.\n
        <p>Here it is to be noted that, in a visible contemplation or meditation—as, for instance, when one
contemplates Christ our Lord, Who is visible—the composition will be to see with the sight of the
imagination the corporeal place where the thing is found which I want to contemplate. I say the
corporeal place, as for instance, a Temple or Mountain where Jesus Christ or Our Lady is found,
according to what I want to contemplate. In an invisible contemplation or meditation—as here on
the Sins—the composition will be to see with the sight of the imagination and consider that my
soul is imprisoned in this corruptible body, and all the compound in this valley, as exiled among
brute beasts: I say all the compound of soul and body.</p>\n
        <b>Second Prelude.</b> The second is to ask God our Lord for what I want and desire.\n
        <p>The petition has to be according to the subject matter; that is, if the contemplation is on the
Resurrection, one is to ask for joy with Christ in joy; if it is on the Passion, he is to ask for pain,
tears and torment with Christ in torment.</p>\n
        <p>Here it will be to ask shame and confusion at myself, seeing how many have been damned for
only one mortal sin, and how many times I deserved to be condemned forever for my so many sins.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> Before all Contemplations or Meditations, there ought always to be made the Preparatory
Prayer, which is not changed, and the two Preludes already mentioned, which are sometimes
changed, according to the subject matter.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point will be to bring the memory on the First Sin, which was that of the
Angels, and then to bring the intellect on the same, discussing it; then the will, wanting to recall
and understand all this in order to make me more ashamed and confound me more, bringing into
comparison with the one sin of the Angels my so many sins, and reflecting, while they for one sin
were cast into Hell, how often I have deserved it for so many.</p>\n
        <p>I say to bring to memory the sin of the Angels, how they, being created in grace, not wanting
to help themselves with their liberty to reverence and obey their Creator and Lord, coming to pride,
were changed from grace to malice, and hurled from Heaven to Hell; and so then to discuss more
in detail with the intellect: and then to move the feelings more with the will.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second is to do the same—that is, to bring the Three Powers—on the sin of
Adam and Eve, bringing to memory how on account of that sin they did penance for so long a time,
and how much corruption came on the human race, so many people going the way to Hell.</p>\n
        <p>I say to bring to memory the Second Sin, that of our First Parents; how after Adam was created
in the field of Damascus and placed in the Terrestrial Paradise, and Eve was created from his rib,
being forbidden to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, they ate and so sinned, and afterwards clothed in
tunics of skins and cast from Paradise, they lived, all their life, without the original justice which
they had lost, and in many labors and much penance. And then to discuss with the understanding
more in detail; and to use the will as has been said.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third is likewise to do the same on the Third particular Sin of any one who
for one mortal sin is gone to Hell—and many others without number, for fewer sins than I have
committed.</p>\n
        <p>I say to do the same on the Third particular Sin, bringing to memory the gravity and malice of
the sin against one’s Creator and Lord; to discuss with the understanding how in sinning and acting
against the Infinite Goodness, he has been justly condemned forever; and to finish with the will as
has been said.</p>\n
        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> Imagining Christ our Lord present and placed on the Cross, let me make a Colloquy,
how from Creator He is come to making Himself man, and from life eternal is come to temporal
death, and so to die for my sins.</p>\n
        <p>Likewise, looking at myself, what I have done for Christ, what I am doing for Christ, what I
ought to do for Christ.</p>\n
        <p>And so, seeing Him such, and so nailed on the Cross, to go over that which will present itself.</p>\n
        <p>The Colloquy is made, properly speaking, as one friend speaks to another, or as a servant to
his master; now asking some grace, now blaming oneself for some misdeed, now communicating
one’s affairs, and asking advice in them.</p>\n

the sins of life, looking from year to year, or from period to period. For this three things are helpful:
first, to look at the place and the house where I have lived; second, the relations I have had with
others; third, the occupation in which I have lived.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to weigh the sins, looking at the foulness and the malice which any
mortal sin committed has in it, even supposing it were not forbidden.</p>\n
        <p>
            <b>Third Point.</b> The third, to look at who I am, lessening myself by examples:\n
            First, how much I am in comparison to all men;\n
            Second, what men are in comparison to all the Angels and Saints of Paradise;\n
            Third, what all Creation is in comparison to God: (—Then I alone, what can I be?)\n
            Fourth, to see all my bodily corruption and foulness;\n
            Fifth, to look at myself as a sore and ulcer, from which have sprung so many sins and so many
iniquities and so very vile poison.\n
        </p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> The fourth, to consider what God is, against Whom I have sinned, according to
His attributes; comparing them with their contraries in me—His Wisdom with my ignorance; His
Omnipotence with my weakness; His Justice with my iniquity; His Goodness with my malice.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Point.</b> The fifth, an exclamation of wonder with deep feeling, going through all creatures,
how they have left me in life and preserved me in it; the Angels, how, though they are the sword
of the Divine Justice, they have endured me, and guarded me, and prayed for me; the Saints, how
they have been engaged in interceding and praying for me; and the heavens, sun, moon, stars, and
elements, fruits, birds, fishes and animals—and the earth, how it has not opened to swallow me up,
creating new Hells for me to suffer in them forever!</p>\n
        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> Let me finish with a Colloquy of mercy, pondering and giving thanks to God our
Lord that He has given me life up to now, proposing amendment, with His grace, for the future.

        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> Making a Colloquy to Christ our Lord, I will bring to memory the souls that are in
Hell, some because they did not believe the Coming, others because, believing, they did not act
according to His Commandments; making three divisions:</p>\n
        <p>First, Second, and Third Divisions. The first, before the Coming; the second, during His life;
the third, after His life in this world; and with this I will give Him thanks that He has not let me
fall into any of these divisions, ending my life.</p>\n
        <p>Likewise, I will consider how up to now He has always had so great pity and mercy on me.</p>\n
        <p>I will end with an Our Father.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> The first Exercise will be made at midnight; the second immediately on rising in the
morning; the third, before or after Mass; in any case, before dinner; the fourth at the hour of Vespers;
the fifth, an hour before supper.</p>\n
        <p>This arrangement of hours, more or less, I always mean in all the four Weeks, according as his
age, disposition and physical condition help the person who is exercising himself to make five
Exercises or fewer.</p>\n

        <string name="spe_first_week_additions_sub1">TO MAKE THE EXERCISES BETTER AND TO FIND BETTER WHAT ONE DESIRES</string>
        <string name="spe_first_week_additions_content">
        <b>First Addition.</b> The first Addition is, after going to bed, just when I want to go asleep, to think,
        for the space of a Hail Mary, of the hour that I have to rise and for what, making a resume of the Exercise which I have to make.\n
        <p><b>Second Addition.</b> The second: When I wake up, not giving place to any other thought, to turn
my attention immediately to what I am going to contemplate in the first Exercise, at midnight,
bringing myself to confusion for my so many sins, setting examples, as, for instance, if a knight
found himself before his king and all his court, ashamed and confused at having much offended
him, from whom he had first received many gifts and many favors: in the same way, in the second
Exercise, making myself a great sinner and in chains; that is to say going to appear bound as in
chains before the Supreme Eternal Judge; taking for an example how prisoners in chains and already
deserving death, appear before their temporal judge. And I will dress with these thoughts or with
others, according to the subject matter.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Addition.</b> The third: A step or two before the place where I have to contemplate or
meditate, I will put myself standing for the space of an Our Father, my intellect raised on high,
considering how God our Lord is looking at me, etc.; and will make an act of reverence or humility.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Addition.</b> The fourth: To enter on the contemplation now on my knees, now prostrate
on the earth, now lying face upwards, now seated, now standing, always intent on seeking what I
want.</p>\n
        <p>We will attend to two things. The first is, that if I find what I want kneeling, I will not pass on;
and if prostrate, likewise, etc. The second; in the Point in which I find what I want, there I will rest,
without being anxious to pass on, until I content myself.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Addition.</b> The fifth: After finishing the Exercise, I will, during the space of a quarter of
an hour, seated or walking leisurely, look how it went with me in the Contemplation or Meditation;
and if badly, I will look for the cause from which it proceeds, and having so seen it, will be sorry,
in order to correct myself in future; and if well, I will give thanks to God our Lord, and will do in
like manner another time.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Addition.</b> The sixth: Not to want to think on things of pleasure or joy, such as heavenly
glory, the Resurrection, etc. Because whatever consideration of joy and gladness hinders our feeling
pain and grief and shedding tears for our sins: but to keep before me that I want to grieve and feel
pain, bringing to memory rather Death and Judgment.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Addition.</b> The seventh: For the same end, to deprive myself of all light, closing the
blinds and doors while I am in the room, if it be not to recite prayers, to read and eat.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eighth Addition.</b> The eighth: Not to laugh nor say a thing provocative of laughter.</p>\n
        <p><b>Ninth Addition.</b> The ninth: To restrain my sight, except in receiving or dismissing the person
with whom I have spoken.</p>\n
        <p><b>Tenth Addition.</b> The tenth Addition is penance.</p>\n
        <p>This is divided into interior and exterior. The interior is to grieve for one’s sins, with a firm
purpose of not committing them nor any others. The exterior, or fruit of the first, is chastisement
for the sins committed, and is chiefly taken in three ways.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Way.</b> The first is as to eating. That is to say, when we leave off the superfluous, it is not
penance, but temperance. It is penance when we leave off from the suitable; and the more and more,
the greater and better—provided that the person does not injure himself, and that no notable illness
follows.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Way.</b> The second, as to the manner of sleeping. Here too it is not penance to leave off
the superfluous of delicate or soft things, but it is penance when one leaves off from the suitable
in the manner: and the more and more, the better—provided that the person does not injure himself
and no notable illness follows. Besides, let not anything of the suitable sleep be left off, unless in
order to come to the mean, if one has a bad habit of sleeping too much.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Way.</b> The third, to chastise the flesh, that is, giving it sensible pain, which is given by
wearing haircloth or cords or iron chains next to the flesh, by scourging or wounding oneself, and
by other kinds of austerity.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> What appears most suitable and most secure with regard to penance is that the pain should
be sensible in the flesh and not enter within the bones, so that it give pain and not illness. For this
it appears to be more suitable to scourge oneself with thin cords, which give pain exteriorly, rather
than in another way which would cause notable illness within.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> The first Note is that the exterior penances are done chiefly for three ends: First,
as satisfaction for the sins committed;</p>\n
        <p>Second, to conquer oneself—that is, to make sensuality obey reason and all inferior parts be
more subject to the superior;</p>\n
        <p>Third, to seek and find some grace or gift which the person wants and desires; as, for instance,
if he desires to have interior contrition for his sins, or to weep much over them, or over the pains
and sufferings which Christ our Lord suffered in His Passion, or to settle some doubt in which the
person finds himself.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> The second: It is to be noted that the first and second Addition have to be made
for the Exercises of midnight and at daybreak, but not for those which will be made at other times;
and the fourth Addition will never be made in church in the presence of others, but in private, as
at home, etc.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Note.</b> The third: When the person who is exercising himself does not yet find what he
desires—as tears, consolations, etc.,—it often helps for him to make a change in food, in sleep and
in other ways of doing penance, so that he change himself, doing penance two or three days, and
two or three others not. For it suits some to do more penance and others less, and we often omit
doing penance from sensual love and from an erroneous judgment that the human system will not
be able to bear it without notable illness; and sometimes, on the contrary, we do too much, thinking
that the body can bear it; and as God our Lord knows our nature infinitely better, often in such
changes He gives each one to perceive what is suitable for him.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Note.</b> The fourth: Let the Particular Examen be made to rid oneself of defects and
negligences on the Exercises and Additions. And so in the Second, Third and Fourth Weeks.</p>\n

        <p><b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is a composition, seeing the place: it will be here to see with
the sight of the imagination, the synagogues, 5 villages and towns through which Christ our Lord
preached.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, to ask for the grace which I want: it will be here to ask grace of
our Lord that I may not be deaf to His call, but ready and diligent to fulfill His most Holy Will.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point is, to put before me a human king chosen by God our Lord, whom
all Christian princes and men reverence and obey.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to look how this king speaks to all his people, saying: “It is my Will
to conquer all the land of unbelievers. Therefore, whoever would like to come with me is to be
content to eat as I, and also to drink and dress, etc., as I: likewise he is to labor like me 6 in the day
and watch in the night, etc., that so afterwards he may have part with me in the victory, as he has
had it in the labors.”</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to consider what the good subjects ought to answer to a King so liberal
and so kind, and hence, if any one did not accept the appeal of such a king, how deserving he would
be of being censured by all the world, and held for a mean-spirited knight.</p>\n

        The second part of this Exercise consists in applying the above parable of the temporal King to Christ our
        Lord, conformably to the three Points mentioned.\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> And as to the first Point, if we consider such a call of the temporal King to his
subjects, how much more worthy of consideration is it to see Christ our Lord, King eternal, and
before Him all the entire world, which and each one in particular He calls, and says: “It is My will
to conquer all the world and all enemies and so to enter into the glory of My Father; therefore,
whoever would like to come with Me is to labor with Me, that following Me in the pain, he may
also follow Me in the glory.”</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to consider that all those who have judgment and reason will offer
their entire selves to the labor.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, those who will want to be more devoted and signalise themselves in
all service of their King Eternal and universal Lord, not only will offer their persons to the labor,
but even, acting against their own sensuality and against their carnal and worldly love, will make
offerings of greater value and greater importance, saying:</p>\n
        <p>“Eternal Lord of all things, I make my oblation with Thy favor and help, in presence of Thy
infinite Goodness and in presence of Thy glorious Mother and of all the Saints of the heavenly
Court; that I want and desire, and it is my deliberate determination, if only it be Thy greater service
and praise, to imitate Thee in bearing all injuries and all abuse and all poverty of spirit, and actual
poverty, too, if Thy most Holy Majesty wants to choose and receive me to such life and state.”</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> This Exercise will be made twice in the day; namely, in the morning on rising and
an hour before dinner or before supper.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> For the Second Week and so on, it is very helpful to read at intervals in the books
of the Imitation of Christ, or of the Gospels, and of lives of Saints.</p>\n

        <b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is to bring up the narrative of the thing which I have to
contemplate.\n
        <p>Here, it is how the Three Divine Persons looked at all the plain or circuit of all the world, full
of men, and how, seeing that all were going down to Hell, it is determined in Their Eternity, that
the Second Person shall become man to save the human race, and so, the fullness of times being
come, They sent the Angel St. Gabriel to Our Lady (p. 133).</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, a composition, seeing the place: here it will be to see the great
capacity and circuit of the world, in which are so many and such different people: then likewise,
in particular, the house and rooms of Our Lady in the city of Nazareth, in the Province of Galilee.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Prelude.</b> The third, to ask for what I want: it will be to ask for interior knowledge of the
Lord, Who for me has become man, that I may more love and follow Him.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> It is well to note here that this same Preparatory Prayer, without changing it, as was said
in the beginning, and the same three Preludes, are to be made in this Week and in the others
following, changing the form according to the subject matter.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point is, to see the various persons: and first those on the surface of the
earth, in such variety, in dress as in actions: some white and others black; some in peace and others
in war; some weeping and others laughing; some well, others ill; some being born and others dying,
etc.</p>\n
        <p>To see and consider the Three Divine Persons, as on their royal throne or seat of Their Divine
Majesty, how They look on all the surface and circuit of the earth, and all the people in such
blindness, and how they are dying and going down to Hell.</p>\n
        <p>To see Our Lady, and the Angel who is saluting her, and to reflect in order to get profit from
such a sight.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to hear what the persons on the face of the earth are saying, that is,
how they are talking with one another, how they swear and blaspheme, etc.; and likewise what the
Divine Persons are saying, that is: “Let Us work the redemption of the Human race,” etc.; and then
what the Angel and Our Lady are saying; and to reflect then so as to draw profit from their words.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to look then at what the persons on the face of the earth are doing, as,
for instance, killing, going to Hell etc.; likewise what the Divine Persons are doing, namely, working
out the most holy Incarnation, etc.; and likewise what the Angel and Our Lady are doing, namely,
the Angel doing his duty as ambassador, and Our Lady humbling herself and giving thanks to the
Divine Majesty; and then to reflect in order to draw some profit from each of these things.</p>\n
        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> At the end a Colloquy is to be made, thinking what I ought to say to the Three Divine
Persons, or to the Eternal Word incarnate, or to our Mother and Lady, asking according to what I
feel in me, in order more to follow and imitate Our Lord, so lately incarnate.</p>\n
        <p>I will say an Our Father.</p>\n

        <b>Prayer.</b> The usual Preparatory Prayer.\n
        <p><b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is the narrative and it will be here how Our Lady went forth
from Nazareth, about nine months with child, as can be piously meditated, seated on an ass, and
accompanied by Joseph and a maid, taking an ox, to go to Bethlehem to pay the tribute which
Caesar imposed on all those lands (p. 135).</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be here to see with the
sight of the imagination the road from Nazareth to Bethlehem; considering the length and the breadth,
            and whether such road is level or through valleys or over hills; likewise looking at the
place or cave of the Nativity, how large, how small, how low, how high, and how it was prepared.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Prelude.</b> The third will be the same, and in the same form, as in the preceding
Contemplation.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point is to see the persons; that is, to see Our Lady and Joseph and the
maid, and, after His Birth, the Child Jesus, I making myself a poor creature and a wretch of an
unworthy slave, looking at them and serving them in their needs, with all possible respect and
reverence, as if I found myself present; and then to reflect on myself in order to draw some profit.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to look, mark and contemplate what they are saying, and, reflecting
on myself, to draw some profit.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to look and consider what they are doing, as going a journey and
laboring, that the Lord may be born in the greatest poverty; and as a termination of so many
labors—of hunger, of thirst, of heat and of cold, of injuries and affronts—that He may die on the
Cross; and all this for me: then reflecting, to draw some spiritual profit.</p>\n
        <p>Colloquy. I will finish with a Colloquy as in the preceding Contemplation, and with an Our

        <b>Prayer.</b> After the Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, it is helpful to pass the
        five senses of the imagination through the first and second Contemplation, in the following way:\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point is to see the persons with the sight of the imagination, meditating
and contemplating in particular the details about them and drawing some profit from the sight.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to hear with the hearing what they are, or might be, talking about
and, reflecting on oneself, to draw some profit from it.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to smell and to taste with the smell and the taste the infinite fragrance
and sweetness of the Divinity, of the soul, and of its virtues, and of all, according to the person who
is being contemplated; reflecting on oneself and drawing profit from it.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> The fourth, to touch with the touch, as for instance, to embrace and kiss the
places where such persons put their feet and sit, always seeing to my drawing profit from it.</p>\n
        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> One has to finish with one Colloquy as in the first and second Contemplation, and
with an Our Father.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> The first note is to remark for all this and the other following Weeks, that I have
only to read the Mystery of the Contemplation which I have immediately to make, so that at any
time I read no Mystery which I have not to make that day or at that hour, in order that the
consideration of one Mystery may not hinder the consideration of the other.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> The second: The first Exercise, on the Incarnation, will be made at midnight; the
second at dawn; the third at the hour of Mass; the fourth at the hour of Vespers, and the fifth before
the hour of supper, being for the space of one hour in each one of the five Exercises; and the same
order will be taken in all the following.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Note.</b> The third: It is to be remarked that if the person who is making the Exercises is
old or weak, or, although strong, has become in some way less strong from the First Week, it is
better for him in this Second Week, at least sometimes, not rising at midnight, to make one
Contemplation in the morning, and another at the hour of Mass, and another before dinner, and one
repetition on them at the hour of Vespers, and then the Application of the Senses before supper.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Note.</b> The fourth: In this Second Week, out of all the ten Additions which were
mentioned in the First Week, the second, the sixth, the seventh and in part the tenth have to be
changed.</p>\n
        <p>In the second it will be, immediately on waking up, to put before me the contemplation which
I have to make, desiring to know more the Eternal Word incarnate, in order to serve and to follow
Him more.</p>\n
        <p>The sixth will be to bring frequently to memory the Life and Mysteries of Christ our Lord, from
His Incarnation down to the place or Mystery which I am engaged in contemplating.</p>\n
        <p>The seventh will be, that one should manage as to keeping darkness or light, making use of
good weather or bad, according as he feels that it can profit and help him to find what the person
desires who is exercising himself.</p>\n
        <p>And in the tenth Addition, he who is exercising himself ought to manage himself according to
the Mysteries which he is contemplating; because some demand penance and others not.</p>\n
        <p>All the ten Additions, then, are to be made with great care.</p>\n
        <p>Fifth Note. The fifth note: In all the Exercises, except in that of midnight and in that of the
morning, the equivalent of the second Addition will be taken in the following way:—Immediately
on recollecting that it is the time of the Exercise which I have to make, before I go,
            putting before myself where I am going and before Whom, and summarizing a little the Exercise which I have to
make, and then making the third Addition, I will enter into the Exercise.</p>\n

to cast out nets and chains; that they have first to tempt with a longing for riches—as he is
accustomed to do in most cases 12 —that men may more easily come to vain honor of the world, and
then to vast pride. So that the first step shall be that of riches; the second, that of honor; the third,
that of pride; and from these three steps he draws on to all the other vices.</p>\n

        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to consider how the Lord of all the world chooses so many
persons—Apostles, Disciples, etc.,—and sends them through all the world spreading His sacred
doctrine through all states and conditions of persons.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to consider the discourse which Christ our Lord makes to all His servants
and friends whom He sends on this expedition, recommending them to want to help all, by bringing
them first to the highest spiritual poverty, and—if His Divine Majesty would be served and would
want to choose them—no less to actual poverty; the second is to be of contumely and contempt;
because from these two things humility follows. So that there are to be three steps; the first, poverty
against riches; the second, contumely or contempt against worldly honor; the third, humility against
pride. And from these three steps let them induce to all the other virtues.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Colloquy.</b> One Colloquy to Our Lady, that she may get me grace from Her Son and Lord
that I may be received under His standard; and first in the highest spiritual poverty, and—if His
Divine Majesty would be served and would want to choose and receive me—not less in actual
poverty; second, in suffering contumely and injuries, to imitate Him more in them, if only I can
suffer them without the sin of any person, or displeasure of His Divine Majesty; and with that a
Hail Mary.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Colloquy.</b> I will ask the same of the Son, that He may get it for me of the Father; and
with that say the Soul of Christ.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Colloquy.</b> I will ask the same of the Father, that He may grant it to me; and say an Our
Father.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> This Exercise will be made at midnight and then a second time in the morning, and two
repetitions of this same will be made at the hour of Mass and at the hour of Vespers, always finishing
with the three Colloquies, to Our Lady, to the Son, and to the Father; and that on The Pairs which
follows, at the hour before supper.</p>\n

        <b>Prayer.</b> The usual Preparatory Prayer.\n
        <p><b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is the narrative, which is of three pairs of men, and each one
of them has acquired ten thousand ducats, not solely or as they ought 13 for God’s love, and all want
to save themselves and find in peace God our Lord, ridding themselves of the weight and hindrance
to it which they have in the attachment for the thing acquired.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be here to see myself,
how I stand before God our Lord and all His Saints, to desire and know what is more pleasing to
His Divine Goodness.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Prelude.</b> The third, to ask for what I want. Here it will be to ask grace to choose what
is more to the glory of His Divine Majesty and the salvation of my soul.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Pair.</b> The first Pair would want to rid themselves of the attachment which they have to
the thing acquired, in order to find in peace God our Lord, and be able to save themselves, and they
do not place the means up to the hour of death.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Pair.</b> The second want to rid themselves of the attachment, but want so to rid themselves
of it as to remain with the thing acquired, so that God should come where they want, and they do
not decide to leave it in order to go to God, although it would be the best state for them</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Pair.</b> The third want to rid themselves of the attachment, but want so to rid themselves
of it that they have even no liking for it, to keep the thing acquired or not to keep it, but only want
to want it or not want it according as God our Lord will put in their will and as will appear to them
better for the service and praise of His Divine Majesty; and meanwhile they want to reckon that
they quit it all in attachment, forcing themselves not to want that or any other thing, unless only
the service of God our Lord move them: so that the desire of being better able to serve God our
Lord moves them to take the thing or leave it.</p>\n
        <p><b>Three Colloquies.</b> I will make the same three Colloquies which were made in the Contemplation
preceding, on the Two Standards.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> It is to be noted that when we feel a tendency or repugnance against actual poverty, when
we are not indifferent to poverty or riches, it is very helpful, in order to crush such disordered
tendency, to ask in the Colloquies (although it be against the flesh) that the Lord should choose
one to actual poverty, and that one wants, asks and begs it, if only it be the service and praise of
His Divine Goodness.</p>\n

        <b>Twelfth Day.</b> On Palm Sunday (p. 151).\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> The first note is that in the Contemplations of this Second Week, according to the
time each one wants to spend, or according as he gets profit, he can lengthen or shorten: if he
lengthens, taking the Mysteries of the Visitation of Our Lady to St. Elizabeth, the Shepherds, the
Circumcision of the Child Jesus, and the Three Kings, and so of others; and if he shortens, he can
even omit some of those which are set down. Because this is to give an introduction and way to
contemplate better and more completely afterwards.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> The second: The matter of the Elections will be begun from the Contemplation
on Nazareth to the Jordan, taken inclusively, which is the fifth day, as is explained in the following.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Note.</b> The third: Before entering on the Elections, that a man may get attachment to the
true doctrine of Christ our Lord, it is very helpful to consider and mark the following three Manners
of Humility, reflecting on them occasionally through all the day, and also making the Colloquies,
as will be said later.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Humility.</b> The first manner of Humility is necessary for eternal salvation; namely, that I
so lower and so humble myself, as much as is possible to me, that in everything I obey the law of
God, so that, even if they made me lord of all the created things in this world, nor for my own
temporal life, I would not be in deliberation about breaking a Commandment, whether Divine or
human, which binds me under mortal sin.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Humility.</b> The second is more perfect Humility than the first; namely, if I find myself
at such a stage that I do not want, and feel no inclination to have, riches rather than poverty, to want
honor rather than dishonor, to desire a long rather than a short life—the service of God our Lord
and the salvation of my soul being equal; and so not for all creation, nor because they would take
away my life, would I be in deliberation about committing a venial sin.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Humility.</b> The third is most perfect Humility; namely, when—including the first and
second, and the praise and glory of the Divine Majesty being equal—in order to imitate and be
more actually like Christ our Lord, I want and choose poverty with Christ poor rather than riches,
opprobrium with Christ replete with it rather than honors; and to desire to be rated as worthless
and a fool for Christ, Who first was held as such, rather than wise or prudent in this world.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> So, it is very helpful for whoever desires to get this third Humility, to make the three
already mentioned Colloquies of The Pairs, asking that Our Lord would be pleased to choose him
to this third greater and better Humility, in order more to imitate and serve Him, if it be equal or
greater service and praise to His Divine Majesty.</p>\n
    </string>
        <string name="spe_prelude_for_making_election_content">
        <p><b>First Point.</b> In every good election, as far as depends on us,
            the eye of our intention ought to be simple, only looking at what we are created for, namely,
            the praise of God our Lord and the salvation of our soul.
            And so I ought to choose whatever I do, that it may help me for the end for which I am created,
            not ordering or bringing the end to the means, but the means to the end: as it happens that many choose
            first to marry—which is a means—and secondarily
            to serve God our Lord in the married life—which service of God is the end. So, too, there are others who first want to have benefices, and then to serve God in them. So that those do not go straight to God, but want
God to come straight to their disordered tendencies, and consequently they make a means of the
end, and an end of the means. So that what they had to take first, they take last; because first we
have to set as our aim the wanting to serve God,—which is the end,—and secondarily, to take a
benefice, or to marry, if it is more suitable to us,—which is the means for the end. So, nothing
ought to move me to take such means or to deprive myself of them, except only the service and
praise of God our Lord and the eternal salvation of my soul.</p>\n
        <p>TO GET KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHAT MATTERS AN ELECTION OUGHT TO BE MADE
ABOUT, AND IT CONTAINS FOUR POINTS AND ONE NOTE</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point: It is necessary that everything about which we want to make an
election should be indifferent, or good, in itself, and should be allowed within our Holy Mother
the hierarchical Church, and not bad nor opposed to her.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> Second: There are some things which fall under unchangeable election, such as
are the priesthood, marriage, etc. There are others which fall under an election that can be changed,
such as are to take benefices or leave them, to take temporal goods or rid oneself of them.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> Third: In the unchangeable Election which has already been once made—such
as marriage, the priesthood, etc.—there is nothing more to choose, because one cannot release
himself; only it is to be seen to that if one have not made his election duly and ordinately and
without disordered tendencies, repenting let him see to living a good life in his election. It does not
appear that this election is a Divine vocation, 15 as being an election out of order and awry. Many
err in this, setting up a perverse or bad election as a Divine 16 vocation; for every Divine vocation
is always pure and clear, without mixture of flesh, or of any other inordinate tendency.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> Fourth: If some one has duly and ordinately made election of things which are
under election that can be changed, and has not yielded to flesh or world, there is no reason for his
making election anew, but let him perfect himself as much as he can in that already chosen.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> It is to be remarked that if such election that can be changed was not made sincerely and
well in order, then it helps to make the election duly, if one has a desire that fruits notable and very
pleasing to God our Lord should come from him.</p>\n

        THREE TIMES\n FOR MAKING, IN ANY ONE OF THEM, A SOUND\n AND GOOD ELECTION
    </string>

        <string name="spe_prelude_for_making_election_content1">
        <b>First Time.</b> The first time is, when God our Lord so moves and attracts the will, that without doubting, or being able to doubt, such devout soul follows what is shown it, as St. Paul and St. Matthew did in following Christ our Lord.\n
        <p><b>Second Time.</b> The second, when enough light and knowledge is received by experience of
consolations and desolations, and by the experience of the discernment of various spirits.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Time.</b> The third time is quiet, when one considers, first, for what man is born—namely,
to praise God our Lord and save his soul—and desiring this chooses as means a life or state within
the limits of the Church, in order that he may be helped in the service of his Lord and the salvation
of his soul.</p>\n
        <p>I said time of quiet, when the soul is not acted on by various spirits, and uses its natural powers
freely and tranquilly.</p>\n
        <p>If election is not made in the first or the second time, two ways follow as to this third time for
making it.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_prelude_for_making_election_content2">
        It contains six Points.\n
        First Point. The first Point is to put before me the thing on which I want to make election, such as an office or benefice, either to take or leave it; or any other thing whatever which falls under an election that can be changed.\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> Second: It is necessary to keep as aim the end for which I am created, which is
to praise God our Lord and save my soul, and, this supposed, to find myself indifferent, without
any inordinate propensity; so that I be not more inclined or disposed to take the thing proposed
than to leave it, nor more to leave it than to take it, but find myself as in the middle of a balance,
to follow what I feel to be more for the glory and praise of God our Lord and the salvation of my
soul.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> Third: To ask of God our Lord to be pleased to move my will and put in my soul
what I ought to do regarding the thing proposed, so as to promote more His praise and glory;
discussing well and faithfully with my intellect, and choosing agreeably to His most holy pleasure
and will.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> Fourth: To consider, reckoning up, how many advantages and utilities follow
for me from holding the proposed office or benefice for only the praise of God our Lord and the
salvation of my soul, and, to consider likewise, on the contrary, the disadvantages and dangers
which there are in having it. Doing the same in the second part, that is, looking at the advantages
and utilities there are in not having it, and likewise, on the contrary, the disadvantages and dangers
in not having the same.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Point.</b> Fifth: After I have thus discussed and reckoned up on all sides about the thing
proposed, to look where reason more inclines: and so, according to the greater inclination of reason,
and not according to any inclination of sense, deliberation should be made on the thing proposed.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Point.</b> Sixth, such election, or deliberation, made, the person who has made it ought to
go with much diligence to prayer before God our Lord and offer Him such election, that His Divine
Majesty may be pleased to receive and confirm it, if it is to His greater service and praise.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_prelude_for_making_election_content3">
        It contains four Rules and one Note. \n
        <b>First Rule.</b> The first is that that love which moves me and makes me choose such thing should descend from above, from the love of God, so that he who chooses feel first in himself that that love, more or less, which he has for the thing which he chooses, is only for his Creator and Lord.\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second, to set before me a man whom I have never seen nor known, and I 17
desiring all his perfection, to consider what I would tell him to do and elect for the greater glory
of God our Lord, and the greater perfection of his soul, and I, doing likewise, to keep the rule which
I set for the other.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third, to consider, as if I were at the point of death, the form and measure
which I would then want to have kept in the way of the present election, and regulating myself by
that election, let me make my decision in everything.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Rule.</b> The fourth, looking and considering how I shall find myself on the Day of
Judgment, to think how I would then want to have 18 deliberated about the present matter, and to
take now the rule which I would then wish to have kept, in order that I may then find myself in
entire pleasure and joy.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> The above-mentioned rules for my eternal salvation and peace having been taken, I will
make my election and offering to God our Lord, conformably to the sixth Point of the First Way
of making election.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_prelude_for_making_election_content4">
        It is to be noted that as to those who are settled in ecclesiastical office or in matrimony—whether they abound much or not in temporal goods—when they have no opportunity or have not a very prompt will to make election about the things which fall under an election that can be changed, it is very helpful, in place of making election, to give them a form and way to amend and reform each his own life and state. That is, putting his creation, life and state for the glory and praise of God our Lord and the salvation of his own soul, to come and arrive at this end, he ought to consider much and ponder through the Exercises and Ways of Election, as has been explained, how large a house and household he ought to keep, how he ought to rule and govern it, how he ought to teach and instruct it by word and by example; likewise of his means, how much he ought to take for his household and house; and how much to dispense to the poor and to other pious objects, not wanting nor seeking any other thing except in all and through all the greater praise and glory of God our Lord.\n
        <p>For let each one think that he will benefit himself in all spiritual things in proportion as he goes
out of his self-love, will and interest.</p>\n

        <p><b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is to bring to memory the narrative; which is here how Christ
our Lord sent two Disciples from Bethany to Jerusalem to prepare the Supper, and then He Himself
went there with the other Disciples; and how, after having eaten the Paschal Lamb, and having
supped, He washed their feet and gave His most Holy Body and Precious Blood to His Disciples,
and made them a discourse, after Judas went to sell his Lord.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, a composition, seeing the place. It will be here to consider the
road from Bethany to Jerusalem, whether broad, whether narrow, whether level, etc.; likewise the
place of the Supper, whether large, whether small, whether of one kind or whether of another.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Prelude.</b> The third, to ask for what I want. It will be here grief, feeling and confusion
because for my sins the Lord is going to the Passion.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The first Point is to see the persons of the Supper, and, reflecting on myself, to see
to drawing some profit from them.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to hear what they are talking about, and likewise to draw some
profit from it.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to look at what they are doing, and draw some profit.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> The fourth, to consider that which Christ our Lord is suffering in His Humanity, 19
or wants to suffer, according to the passage which is being contemplated, and here to commence
with much vehemence and to force myself to grieve, be sad and weep, and so to labor through the
other points which follow.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Point.</b> The fifth, to consider how the Divinity hides Itself, that is, how It could destroy
Its enemies and does not do it, and how It leaves the most sacred Humanity to suffer so very cruelly.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Point.</b> The sixth, to consider how He suffers all this for my sins, etc.; and what I ought
to do and suffer for Him.</p>\n
        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> I will finish with a Colloquy to Christ our Lord, and, at the end, with an Our Father.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> It is to be noted, as was explained before and in part, that in the Colloquies I ought to
discuss and ask according to the subject matter, that is, according as I find myself tempted or consoled, and according as I desire to have one virtue or another, as I want to dispose of myself in
one direction or another, as I want to grieve or rejoice at the thing which I am contemplating; in
fine, asking that which I more efficaciously desire as to any particular things. And in this way I
can make one Colloquy only, to Christ our Lord, or, if the matter or devotion move me, three
Colloquies, one to the Mother, another to the Son, another to the Father, in the same form as was
said in the Second Week, in the meditation of the Three Pairs, with the Note which follows The

        <b>Prayer.</b> The usual Preparatory Prayer\n
        <p><b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is the narrative and it will be here how Christ our Lord went
down with His eleven Disciples from Mount Sion, where He made the Supper, to the Valley of
Josaphat. Leaving the eight in a part of the Valley and the other three in a part of the Garden, and
putting Himself in prayer, He sweats sweat as drops of blood, 20 and after He prayed three times to
the Father and wakened His three Disciples, and after the enemies at His voice fell down, Judas
giving Him the kiss of peace, and St. Peter cutting off the ear of Malchus, and Christ putting it in
its place; being taken as a malefactor, they lead Him down the valley, and then up the side, to the
house of Annas.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second is to see the place. It will be here to consider the road from Mount
Sion to the Valley of Josaphat, and likewise the Garden, whether wide, whether large, whether of
one kind, whether of another.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Prelude.</b> The third is to ask for what I want. It belongs to the Passion to ask for grief
with Christ in grief, anguish with Christ in anguish, tears and interior pain at such great pain which
Christ suffered for me.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> In this second Contemplation, after the Preparatory Prayer is made, with the three
Preludes already mentioned, the same form of proceeding will be kept through the Points and
Colloquy as was kept in the first Contemplation, on the Supper.</p>\n
        <p>And at the hour of Mass and Vespers two repetitions will be made on the first and second
Contemplation, and then, before supper, the senses will be applied on the two above-said
Contemplations, always prefixing the Preparatory Prayer and the three Preludes, according to the
subject matter, in the same form as was said and explained in the Second Week.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> According as age, disposition and physical condition help the person who is
exercising himself, he will make each day the five Exercises or fewer.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Note.</b> In this Third Week the second and sixth Additions will in part be changed.</p>\n
        <p>The second will be, immediately on awaking, to set before me where I am going and to what,
and summing up a little the contemplation which I want to make, according as the Mystery shall
be, to force myself, while I am getting up and dressing, to be sad and grieve over such great grief
and such great suffering of Christ our Lord.</p>\n
        <p>The sixth will be changed, so as not to try to bring joyful thoughts, although good and holy, as,
for instance, are those on the Resurrection and on heavenly glory, but rather to draw myself to grief
and to pain and anguish, bringing to mind frequently the labors, fatigues and pains of Christ our
Lord, which He suffered from the moment when He was born up to the Mystery of the Passion in
which I find myself at present.</p>\n

Caiphas inclusive (P. 155), and then the two repetitions and the application of the senses, as has
been already said.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Day.</b> The third day, at midnight, from the house of Caiphas to Pilate, inclusive (p. 155);
and in the morning, from Pilate to Herod inclusive (p. 156); and then the repetitions and senses, in
the same form as has been already said.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Day.</b> The fourth day, at midnight, from Herod to Pilate (p. 157), doing and contemplating
up to half through the Mysteries of the same house of Pilate, and then, in the Exercise of the morning,
the other Mysteries which remained of the same house; and the repetitions and the senses, as has
been said.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Day.</b> The fifth day, at midnight, from the house of Pilate up to the Crucifixion (p. 158),
and in the morning from His being raised on the Cross until He expired (p. 158), then the two
repetitions, and the senses.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Day.</b> The sixth day, at midnight, from the Descent from the Cross to the Tomb, exclusive
(p. 159) and in the morning from the Tomb, inclusive, to the house where Our Lady was, after her
Son was buried.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Day.</b> The seventh day, a Contemplation on the whole Passion together, in the Exercise
of midnight and of the morning, and in place of the two repetitions and of the senses one will
consider all that day, as frequently as he can, how the most holy Body of Christ our Lord remained separated and apart from the Soul: and where and how It remained buried. Likewise, one will
consider the loneliness of Our Lady, whose grief and fatigue were so great: then, on the other side,
the loneliness of the Disciples.</p>\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> It is to be noted that whoever wants to dwell more on the Passion, has to take in each
Contemplation fewer Mysteries; that is to say, in the first Contemplation, the Supper only; in the
second, the Washing of the Feet; in the third, the giving of the Blessed Sacrament to them; in the
fourth, the discourse which Christ made to them; and so through the other Contemplations and
Mysteries.</p>\n
        <p>Likewise, after having finished the Passion, let him take for an entire day the half of the whole
Passion, and the second day the other half, and the third day the whole Passion.</p>\n
        <p>On the contrary, whoever would want to shorten more in the Passion, let him take at midnight
the Supper, in the morning the Garden, at the hour of Mass the house of Annas, at the hour of
Vespers the house of Caiphas, in place of the hour before supper the house of Pilate; so that, not
making repetitions, nor the Application of the Senses, he make each day five distinct Exercises,
and in each Exercise take a distinct Mystery of Christ our Lord. And after thus finishing the whole
Passion, he can, another day, do all the Passion together in one Exercise, or in different ones, as it
will seem to him that he will be better able to help himself.</p>\n

        <string name="spe_rules_to_put_oneself_inorder_for_the_future_content">
        <b>First Rule.</b> The first rule is that it is well to abstain less from bread, because it is not a food as to which the appetite is used to act so inordinately, or to which temptation urges as in the case of the other foods.\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second: Abstinence appears more convenient as to drinking, than as to eating
bread. So, one ought to look much what is helpful to him, in order to admit it, and what does him
harm, in order to discard it.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third: As to foods, one ought to have the greatest and most entire abstinence,
because as the appetite is more ready to act inordinately, so temptation is more ready in making
trial, on this head. And so abstinence in foods, to avoid disorder, can be kept in two ways, one by
accustoming oneself to eat coarse foods; the other, if one takes delicate foods, by taking them in
small quantity.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Rule.</b> The fourth: Guarding against falling into sickness, the more a man leaves off
from what is suitable, the more quickly he will reach the mean which he ought to keep in his eating
and drinking; for two reasons: the first, because by so helping and disposing himself, he will many
times experience more the interior knowledge, consolations and Divine inspirations to show him
the mean which is proper for him; the second, because if the person sees himself in such abstinence not with so great corporal strength or disposition for the Spiritual Exercises, he will easily come
to judge what is more suitable to his bodily support.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Rule.</b> The fifth: While the person is eating, let him consider as if he saw Christ our Lord
eating with His Apostles, and how He drinks and how He looks and how He speaks; and let him
see to imitating Him. So that the principal part of the intellect shall occupy itself in the consideration
of Christ our Lord, and the lesser part in the support of the body; because in this way he will get
greater system and order as to how he ought to behave and manage himself.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Rule.</b> The sixth: Another time, while he is eating, he can take another consideration,
either on the life of Saints, or on some pious Contemplation, or on some spiritual affair which he
has to do, because, being intent on such thing, he will take less delight and feeling in the corporal
food.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Rule.</b> The seventh: Above all, let him guard against all his soul being intent on what
he is eating, and in eating let him not go hurriedly, through appetite, but be master of himself, as
well in the manner of eating as in the quantity which he eats.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eighth Rule.</b> The eighth: To avoid disorder, it is very helpful, after dinner or after supper, or
at another hour when one feels no appetite for eating, to decide with oneself for the coming dinner
or supper, and so on, each day, the quantity which it is suitable that he should eat. Beyond this let
him not go because of any appetite or temptation, but rather, in order to conquer more all inordinate
appetite and temptation of the enemy, if he is tempted to eat more, let him eat less.</p>\n

        FOURTH WEEK\n THE FIRST CONTEMPLATION\n HOW CHRIST OUR LORD APPEARED\n TO OUR LADY
    </string>

        <string name="spe_fourth_week_content">
        (p. 160); Prayer. The usual Preparatory Prayer.\n
        <p><b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is the narrative, which is here how, after Christ expired on the
Cross, and the Body, always united with the Divinity, remained separated from the Soul, the blessed
Soul, likewise united with the Divinity, went down to Hell, and taking from there the just souls,
and coming to the Sepulchre and being risen, He appeared to His Blessed Mother in Body and in
Soul.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, a composition, seeing the place; which will be here to see the
arrangement of the Holy Sepulchre and the place or house of Our Lady, looking at its parts in
particular; likewise the room, the oratory, etc.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Prelude.</b> The third, to ask for what I want, and it will be here to ask for grace to rejoice
and be glad intensely at so great glory and joy of Christ our Lord.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point, Second Point, and Third Point.</b> Let the first, second and third Points be the same
usual ones which we took in the Supper of Christ our Lord.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> The fourth, to consider how the Divinity, which seemed to hide Itself in the
Passion, now appears and shows Itself so marvellously in the most holy Resurrection by Its true
and most holy effects.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Point.</b> The fifth is to consider the office of consoling which Christ our Lord bears, and
to compare how friends are accustomed to console friends.</p>\n
        <p><b>Colloquy.</b> I will finish with a Colloquy, or Colloquies, according to the subject matter, and an
Our Father.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> In the following Contemplations let one go on through all the Mysteries of the
Resurrection, in the manner which follows below, up to the Ascension inclusive, taking and keeping
in the rest the same form and manner in all the Week of the Resurrection which was taken in all
the Week of the Passion. So that, for this first Contemplation, on the Resurrection, let one guide
himself as to the Preludes according to the subject matter; and as to the five Points, let them be the
same; and let the Additions which are below be the same; and so in all which remains, he can guide
himself by the method of the Week of the Passion, as in repetitions, the five Senses, in shortening
or lengthening the Mysteries.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> The second note: Commonly in this Fourth Week, it is more suitable than in the
other three past to make four Exercises, and not five: the first, immediately on rising in the morning;
the second, at the hour of Mass, or before dinner, in place of the first repetition; the third, at the
hour of Vespers, in place of the second repetition; the fourth, before supper, bringing the five Senses on the three Exercises of the same day, noting and lingering on the more principal parts, and where
one has felt greater spiritual movements and relish.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Note.</b> The third: Though in all the Contemplations so many Points were given in certain
number—as three, or five, etc., the person who is contemplating can set more or fewer Points,
according as he finds it better for him. For which it is very helpful, before entering on the
Contemplation, to conjecture and mark in certain number the Points which he is to take.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Note.</b> In this fourth week, in all the ten Additions the second, the sixth, the seventh and
the tenth are to be changed.</p>\n
        <p>The second will be, immediately on awaking, to put before me the Contemplation which I have
to make, wanting to arouse feeling and be glad at the great joy and gladness of Christ our Lord.</p>\n
        <p>The sixth, to bring to memory and think of things that move to spiritual pleasure, gladness and
joy, as of heavenly glory.</p>\n
        <p>The seventh, to use light or temporal comforts—as, in summer, the coolness; and in winter, the
sun or heat—as far as the soul thinks or conjectures that it can help it to be joyful in its Creator and
Redeemer.</p>\n
        <p>The tenth: in place of penance, let one regard temperance and all moderation; except it is question
of precepts of fasting or of abstinence which the Church commands; because those are always to
be fulfilled, if there is no just impediment.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_contemplation_to_gain_love_content">
        <b>Note.</b> First, it is well to remark two things: the first is that love ought to be put more in deeds than in words.\n
        <p>The second, love consists in interchange between the two parties; that is to say in the lover’s
giving and communicating to the beloved what he has or out of what he has or can; and so, on the
contrary, the beloved to the lover. So that if the one has knowledge, he give to the one who has it
not. The same of honors, of riches; and so the one to the other.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_contemplation_to_gain_love_content1">
        <b>Prayer.</b> The usual Prayer.\n
        <b>First Prelude.</b> The first Prelude is a composition, which is here to see how I am standing before God our Lord, and of the Angels and of the Saints interceding for me.\n
        <p><b>Second Prelude.</b> The second, to ask for what I want. It will be here to ask for interior knowledge
of so great good received, in order that being entirely grateful, I may be able in all to love and serve
His Divine Majesty.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Point.</b> The First Point is, to bring to memory the benefits received, of Creation, Redemption
and particular gifts, pondering with much feeling how much God our Lord has done for me, and
how much He has given me of what He has, and then the same Lord desires to give me Himself as
much as He can, according to His Divine ordination.</p>\n
        <p>And with this to reflect on myself, considering with much reason and justice, what I ought on
my side to offer and give to His Divine Majesty, that is to say, everything that is mine, and myself
with it, as one who makes an offering with much feeling:</p>\n
        <p>Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my intellect, and all my will—all that I
have and possess. Thou gavest it to me: to Thee, Lord, I return it! All is Thine, dispose of it according
to all Thy will. Give me Thy love and grace, for this is enough for me.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Point.</b> The second, to look how God dwells in creatures, in the elements, giving them
being, in the plants vegetating, in the animals feeling in them, in men giving them to understand: 21
and so in me, giving me being, animating me, giving me sensation and making me to understand; 22
likewise making a temple of me, being created to the likeness and image of His Divine Majesty;
reflecting as much on myself in the way which is said in the first Point, or in another which I feel
to be better. In the same manner will be done on each Point which follows.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Point.</b> The third, to consider how God works and labors for me in all things created on
the face of the earth—that is, behaves like one who labors—as in the heavens, elements, plants,
fruits, cattle, etc., giving them being, preserving them, giving them vegetation and sensation, etc.</p>\n
        <p>Then to reflect on myself.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Point.</b> The fourth, to look how all the good things and gifts descend from above, as my
poor power from the supreme and infinite power from above; and so justice, goodness, pity, mercy,
etc.; as from the sun descend the rays, from the fountain the waters, etc.</p>\n
        <p>Then to finish reflecting on myself, as has been said.</p>\n
        <p>I will end with a Colloquy and an Our Father.</p>\n
    </string>
        <string name="spe_tmop_first_method_content">The first Method of Prayer is on the Ten Commandments, and on the Seven Deadly Sins, on the Three Powers of the Soul and on the Five Bodily Senses. This method of prayer is meant more to give form, method and exercises, how the soul may prepare itself and benefit in them, and that the prayer may be acceptable, rather than to give any form or way of praying.\n</string>

        <string name="spe_tmop_first_method_content1">
        First let the equivalent of the second Addition of the Second Week be made; that is, before entering on the prayer, let the spirit rest a little, the person being seated or walking about, as may seem best to him, considering where he is going and to what. And this same addition will be made at the beginning of all Methods of Prayer.\n
        <p><b>Prayer.</b> A Preparatory Prayer, as, for example, to ask grace of God our Lord that I may be able
to know in what I have failed as to the Ten Commandments; and likewise to beg grace and help to
amend in future, asking for perfect understanding of them, to keep them better and for the greater
glory and praise of His Divine Majesty.</p>\n
        <p>For the first Method of Prayer, it is well to consider and think on the First Commandment, how
I have kept it and in what I have failed, keeping to the rule of spending the space of time one says
the Our Father and the Hail Mary three times; and if in this time I find faults of mine, to ask pardon
and forgiveness for them, and say an Our Father. Let this same method be followed on each one
of the Ten Commandments.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> It is to be noted that when one comes to think on a Commandment on which he
finds he has no habit of sinning, it is not necessary for him to delay so much time, but according
as one finds in himself that he stumbles more or less on that Commandment so he ought to keep
himself more or less on the consideration and examination of it. And the same is to be observed
on the Deadly Sins.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> After having finished the discussion already mentioned on all the Commandments,
accusing myself on them and asking grace and help to amend hereafter, I am to finish with a
Colloquy to God our Lord, according to the subject matter.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_tmop_first_method_content2">About the Seven Deadly Sins, after the Addition, let the Preparatory Prayer be made in the way already mentioned, only with the difference that the matter here is of sins that have to be avoided, and before of Commandments that have to be kept: and likewise let the order and rule already mentioned be kept, and the Colloquy.\n
    <p>In order to know better the faults committed in the Deadly Sins, let their contraries be looked
at: and so, to avoid them better, let the person purpose and with holy exercises see to acquiring and
keeping the seven virtues contrary to them.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_tmop_first_method_content3"><b>Way.</b> On the three powers of the soul let the same order and rule be kept as on the Commandments, making its Addition, Preparatory Prayer and Colloquy.\n</string>

        <string name="spe_tmop_first_method_content4">
        <b>Way.</b> About the five bodily senses the same order always will be kept, but changing their matter.\n
        <p><b>Note.</b> Whoever wants to imitate Christ our Lord in the use of his senses, let him in the
Preparatory Prayer recommend himself to His Divine Majesty, and after considering on each sense,
say a Hail Mary or an Our Father.</p>\n
        <p>And whoever wants to imitate Our Lady in the use of the senses, let him in the Preparatory
Prayer recommend himself to her, that she may get him grace from Her Son and Lord for it; and
after considering on each sense, say a Hail Mary.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_second_method_of_prayer_content">
        It is by contemplating the meaning of each word of the Prayer.\n
        <b>Addition.</b> The same Addition which was in the First Method of Prayer will be in this second.\n
        <b>Prayer.</b> The Preparatory Prayer will be made according to the person to whom the prayer is
addressed.\n
        <p><b>Second Method of Prayer.</b> The Second Method of Prayer is that the person, kneeling or seated,
according to the greater disposition in which he finds himself and as more devotion accompanies
him, keeping the eyes closed or fixed on one place, without going wandering with them, says Father,
and is on the consideration of this word as long as he finds meanings, comparisons, relish and
consolation in considerations pertaining to such word. And let him do in the same way on each
word of the Our Father, or of any other prayer which he wants to say in this way.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Rule.</b> The first Rule is that he will be an hour on the whole Our Father in the manner
already mentioned. Which finished, he will say a Hail Mary, Creed, Soul of Christ, and Hail, Holy
Queen, vocally or mentally, according to the usual way.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The Second Rule is that, should the person who is contemplating the Our Father
find in one word, or in two, matter so good to think over, and relish and consolation, let him not
care to pass on, although the hour ends on what he finds. The hour finished, he will say the rest of
the Our Father in the usual way.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third is that if on one word or two of the Our Father one has lingered for a
whole hour, when he will want to come back another day to the prayer, let him say the above-mentioned word, or the two, as he is accustomed; and on the word which immediately follows
let him commence to contemplate, according as was said in the second Rule.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Note.</b> It is to be noted that, the Our Father finished, in one or in many days, the same has
to be done with the Hail Mary and then with the other prayers, so that for some time one is always
exercising himself in one of them.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> The second note is that, the prayer finished, turning, in few words, to the person
to whom he has prayed, let him ask for the virtues or graces of which he feels he has most need.</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_tmop_third_method_of_prayer_content">
        It will be by rhythm.\n
        <p><b>Addition.</b> The Addition will be the same as in the First and Second Methods of Prayer.</p>\n
        <p><b>Prayer.</b> The Preparatory Prayer will be as in the Second Method of Prayer.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Method of Prayer.</b> The Third Method of Prayer is that with each breath in or out, one
has to pray mentally, saying one word of the Our Father, or of another prayer which is being recited:
so that only one word be said between one breath and another, and while the time from one breath
to another lasts, let attention be given chiefly to the meaning of such word, or to the person to whom
he recites it, or to his own baseness, or to the difference from such great height to his own so great
lowness. And in the same form and rule he will proceed on the other words of the Our Father; and
the other prayers, that is to say, the Hail Mary, the Soul of Christ, the Creed, and the Hail, Holy
Queen, he will make as he is accustomed.</p>\n
        <p><b>First Rule.</b> The First Rule is, on the other day, or at another hour, that he wants to pray, let him
say the Hail Mary in rhythm, and the other prayers as he is accustomed; and so on, going through
the others.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second is that whoever wants to dwell more on the prayer by rhythm, can
say all the above-mentioned prayers or part of them, keeping the same order of the breath by rhythm,
as has been explained.</p>\n

Everything for the greater glory of God; more is not possible. The call to be a Jesuit priest or brother is a call to be a companion of Jesus as St. Ignatius of Loyola was. Becoming a Jesuit is a lifetime project, whose sole aim is to love and serve God.

        <string name="the_jesuits">Jesuits are men who belong to a Roman Catholic religious order called the Society of Jesus, established in 1540 by St. Ignatius of Loyola. It is the largest Catholic religious order in the world with over 18, 500 members. We serve in 127 nations on 6 continents and are organized into administrative regions called Provinces.\n\n The Society of Jesus is involved in a number of ministries including schools and universities, retreat centres, social justice, research agencies, refugee work and media institutions. Our norm is to find where God will best be served and where people will best be helped. As we say, “we find God in all things.”</string>

        <string name="uaps_one">We sense that secular society today profoundly challenges the Church in its task of proclaiming the Gospel. As believers we feel an urgent need to overcome both new secularisms and the nostalgia for cultural expressions of the past. We resolve to collaborate with the Church in experiencing secular society as a sign of the times that affords us the opportunity to renew our presence in the heart of human history. A mature secularized society opens up spaces for the complex dimensions of human freedom, especially religious freedom. In a mature secular society, the conditions exist for the emergence of circumstances conducive to personal religious processes, independent of social or ethnic pressure, that allow people to ask profound questions and to choose freely to follow Jesus, to belong to an ecclesial community, and to adopt a Christian lifestyle in social, economic, cultural, and political sphere</string>
        <string name="uaps_two">Sent as companions in a mission of reconciliation and justice, we resolve to walk with individuals and communities that are vulnerable, excluded, marginalized, and humanly impoverished. We commit ourselves to walk with the victims of abuse of power, abuse of conscience, and sexual abuse; with the outcasts of this world; with all those whom the biblical tradition knows as the poor of the earth, to whose cry the Lord responds with his liberating incarnation.</string>
        <string name="uaps_three">The 2018 Synod recognized young people and their situation as a crucial place from which the Church seeks to perceive and discern the movement of the Holy Spirit through this moment of human history. The poor and the young are a complementary and interwoven locus theologicus. Young people, most of whom are poor, face enormous challenges in our world today, including reduced job opportunities, economic instability, increased political violence, multiple forms of discrimination, progressive degradation of the environment, and other ills, all of which make it difficult for them to find meaning in their lives and to draw closer to God.</string>
        <string name="uaps_four">We resolve, considering who we are and the means that we have, to collaborate with others in the construction of alternative models of life that are based on respect for creation and on a sustainable development capable of producing goods that, when justly distributed, ensure a decent life for all human beings on our planet. The preservation over time of the conditions of life on our planet is a human responsibility of immense ethical and spiritual importance. Our collaboration should include both participating in efforts to analyze problems in depth and promoting reflection and discernment that will guide us in making decisions that help to heal the wounds already inflicted on the delicate ecological balance. We are especially concerned about areas that are so crucial for maintaining the natural equilibrium that makes life possible, such as the Amazon region; the river basins of the Congo, India, and Indonesia; and the great extensions of open sea. Caring for nature in this way is a form of genuinely worshipping the creative work of God. Bold decisions are required to avoid further damage and to bring about lifestyle changes that are necessary so that the goods of creation are used for the benefit of all. We want to be actively present in this process.</string>

        FOR PERCEIVING AND KNOWING IN SOME MANNER THE DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE CAUSED IN THE SOUL\n\n
        THE GOOD, TO RECEIVE THEM, AND THE BAD\n
        TO REJECT THEM. AND THEY ARE MORE\n
        PROPER FOR THE FIRST WEEK.\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_rules_one_content">
        <b>First Rule.</b> The first Rule: In the persons who go from mortal sin to mortal sin, the enemy is commonly used to propose to them apparent pleasures, making them imagine sensual delights and pleasures in order to hold them more and make them grow in their vices and sins. In these persons the good spirit uses the opposite method, pricking them and biting their consciences through the process of reason.\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second: In the persons who are going on intensely cleansing their sins and
rising from good to better in the service of God our Lord, it is the method contrary to that in the
first Rule, for then it is the way of the evil spirit to bite, sadden and put obstacles, disquieting with
false reasons, that one may not go on; and it is proper to the good to give courage and strength,
consolations, tears, inspirations and quiet, easing, and putting away all obstacles, that one may go
on in well doing.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third: Of Spiritual Consolation. I call it consolation when some interior
movement in the soul is caused, through which the soul comes to be inflamed with love of its
Creator and Lord; and when it can in consequence love no created thing on the face of the earth in
itself, but in the Creator of them all.</p>\n
        <p>Likewise, when it sheds tears that move to love of its Lord, whether out of sorrow for one’s
sins, or for the Passion of Christ our Lord, or because of other things directly connected with His
service and praise.</p>\n
        <p>Finally, I call consolation every increase of hope, faith and charity, and all interior joy which
calls and attracts to heavenly things and to the salvation of one’s soul, quieting it and giving it peace
in its Creator and Lord.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Rule.</b> The fourth: Of Spiritual Desolation. I call desolation all the contrary of the third 36
rule, such as darkness of soul, disturbance in it, movement to things low and earthly, the unquiet
of different agitations and temptations, moving to want of confidence, without hope, without love,
when one finds oneself all lazy, tepid, sad, and as if separated from his Creator and Lord. Because,
as consolation is contrary to desolation, in the same way the thoughts which come from consolation
are contrary to the thoughts which come from desolation.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Rule.</b> The fifth: In time of desolation never to make a change; but to be firm and constant
in the resolutions and determination in which one was the day preceding such desolation, or in the
determination in which he was in the preceding consolation. Because, as in consolation it is rather
the good spirit who guides and counsels us, so in desolation it is the bad, with whose counsels we
cannot take a course to decide rightly.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Rule.</b> The sixth: Although in desolation we ought not to change our first resolutions, it
is very helpful intensely to change ourselves against the same desolation, as by insisting more on
prayer, meditation, on much examination, and by giving ourselves more scope in some suitable
way of doing penance.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Rule.</b> The seventh: Let him who is in desolation consider how the Lord has left him
in trial in his natural powers, in order to resist the different agitations and temptations of the enemy;
since he can with the Divine help, which always remains to him, though he does not clearly perceive
it: because the Lord has taken from him his great fervor, great love and intense grace, leaving him,
however, grace enough for eternal salvation.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eighth Rule.</b> The eighth: Let him who is in desolation labor to be in patience, which is contrary
to the vexations which come to him: and let him think that he will soon be consoled, employing
against the desolation the devices, as is said in the sixth Rule.</p>\n
        <p><b>Ninth Rule.</b> The ninth: There are three principal reasons why we find ourselves desolate.
The first is, because of our being tepid, lazy or negligent in our spiritual exercises; and so
through our faults, spiritual consolation withdraws from us.</p>\n
        <p>The second, to try us and see how much we are and how much we let ourselves out in His
service and praise without such great pay of consolation and great graces.</p>\n
        <p>The third, to give us true acquaintance and knowledge, that we may interiorly feel that it is not
ours to get or keep great devotion, intense love, tears, or any other spiritual consolation, but that
all is the gift and grace of God our Lord, and that we may not build a nest in a thing not ours, raising
our intellect into some pride or vainglory, attributing to us devotion or the other things of the
spiritual consolation.</p>\n
        <p><b>Tenth Rule.</b> The tenth: Let him who is in consolation think how he will be in the desolation
which will come after, taking new strength for then.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eleventh Rule.</b> The eleventh: Let him who is consoled see to humbling himself and lowering
himself as much as he can, thinking how little he is able for in the time of desolation without such
grace or consolation.</p>\n
        <p>On the contrary, let him who is in desolation think that he can do much with the grace sufficient
to resist all his enemies, taking strength in his Creator and Lord.</p>\n
        <p><b>Twelfth Rule.</b> The twelfth: The enemy acts like a woman, in being weak against vigor and
strong of will. Because, as it is the way of the woman when she is quarrelling with some man to
lose heart, taking flight when the man shows her much courage: and on the contrary, if the man,
losing heart, begins to fly, the wrath, revenge, and ferocity of the woman is very great, and so
without bounds; in the same manner, it is the way of the enemy to weaken and lose heart, his
temptations taking flight, when the person who is exercising himself in spiritual things opposes a
bold front against the temptations of the enemy, doing diametrically the opposite. And on the
contrary, if the person who is exercising himself commences to have fear and lose heart in suffering
the temptations, there is no beast so wild on the face of the earth as the enemy of human nature in
following out his damnable intention with so great malice.</p>\n
        <p><b>Thirteenth Rule.</b> The thirteenth: Likewise, he acts as a licentious lover in wanting to be secret
and not revealed. For, as the licentious man who, speaking for an evil purpose, solicits a daughter
of a good father or a wife of a good husband, wants his words and persuasions to be secret, and the
contrary displeases him much, when the daughter reveals to her father or the wife to her husband
his licentious words and depraved intention, because he easily gathers that he will not be able to
succeed with the undertaking begun: in the same way, when the enemy of human nature brings his
wiles and persuasions to the just soul, he wants and desires that they be received and kept in secret;
but when one reveals them to his good Confessor or to another spiritual person that knows his
deceits and evil ends, it is very grievous to him, because he gathers, from his manifest deceits being
discovered, that he will not be able to succeed with his wickedness begun.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourteenth Rule.</b> The fourteenth: Likewise, he behaves as a chief bent on conquering and
robbing what he desires: for, as a captain and chief of the army, pitching his camp, and looking at
the forces or defences of a stronghold, attacks it on the weakest side, in like manner the enemy of
human nature, roaming about, looks in turn at all our virtues, theological, cardinal and moral; and
where he finds us weakest and most in need for our eternal salvation, there he attacks us and aims
at taking us.</p>\n

        RULES FOR THE SAME EFFECT WITH GREATER DISCERNMENT OF SPIRITS\n
        AND THEY HELP MORE FOR THE SECOND WEEK\n
    </string>
        <string name="spe_rules_two_content">
        <b>First Rule.</b> The first: It is proper to God and to His Angels in their movements to give true spiritual gladness and joy, taking away all sadness and disturbance which the enemy brings on. Of this latter it is proper to fight against the spiritual gladness and consolation, bringing apparent reasons, subtleties and continual fallacies.\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second: It belongs to God our Lord to give consolation to the soul without
preceding cause, for it is the property of the Creator to enter, go out and cause movements in the
soul, bringing it all into love of His Divine Majesty. I say without cause: without any previous
sense or knowledge of any object through which such consolation would come, through one’s acts
of understanding and will.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third: With cause, as well the good Angel as the bad can console the soul, for
contrary ends: the good Angel for the profit of the soul, that it may grow and rise from good to
better, and the evil Angel, for the contrary, and later on to draw it to his damnable intention and
wickedness.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Rule.</b> The fourth: It is proper to the evil Angel, who forms himself under the appearance
of an angel of light, to enter with the devout soul and go out with himself: that is to say, to bring
good and holy thoughts, conformable to such just soul, and then little by little he aims at coming
out drawing the soul to his covert deceits and perverse intentions.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Rule.</b> The fifth: We ought to note well the course of the thoughts, and if the beginning,
middle and end is all good, inclined to all good, it is a sign of the good Angel; but if in the course
of the thoughts which he brings it ends in something bad, of a distracting tendency, or less good
than what the soul had previously proposed to do, or if it weakens it or disquiets or disturbs the
soul, taking away its peace, tranquillity and quiet, which it had before, it is a clear sign that it
proceeds from the evil spirit, enemy of our profit and eternal salvation.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Rule.</b> The sixth: When the enemy of human nature has been perceived and known by his
serpent’s tail and the bad end to which he leads on, it helps the person who was tempted by him,
to look immediately at the course of the good thoughts which he brought him at their beginning,
and how little by little he aimed at making him descend from the spiritual sweetness and joy in
which he was, so far as to bring him to his depraved intention; in order that with this experience,
known and noted, the person may be able to guard for the future against his usual deceits.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Rule.</b> The seventh: In those who go on from good to better, the good Angel touches
such soul sweetly, lightly and gently, like a drop of water which enters into a sponge; and the evil
touches it sharply and with noise and disquiet, as when the drop of water falls on the stone.</p>\n
        <p>And the above-said spirits touch in a contrary way those who go on from bad to worse.
The reason of this is that the disposition of the soul is contrary or like to the said Angels.
Because, when it is contrary, they enter perceptibly with clatter and noise; and when it is like, they
enter with silence as into their own home, through the open door.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eighth Rule.</b> The eighth: When the consolation is without cause, although there be no deceit
in it, as being of God our Lord alone, as was said; still the spiritual person to whom God gives such
consolation, ought, with much vigilance and attention, to look at and distinguish the time itself of
such actual consolation from the following, in which the soul remains warm and favored with the
favor and remnants of the consolation past; for often in this second time, through one’s own course
of habits and the consequences of the concepts and judgments, or through the good spirit or through
the bad, he forms various resolutions and opinions which are not given immediately by God our
Lord, and therefore they have need to be very well examined before entire credit is given them, or
they are put into effect.</p>\n

        <string name="spe_rules_three_title">
        IN THE MINISTRY OF DISTRIBUTING ALMS\n
        THE FOLLOWING RULES SHOULD BE KEPT\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_rules_three_content">
        <b>First Rule.</b> The first: If I make the distribution to relatives or friends, or to persons for whom I have an affection,
        I shall have four things to see to, of which mention was made, in part, in the matter of Election.\n
        <p>The first is, that that love which moves me and makes me give the alms, should descend from
above, from the love of God our Lord, so that I feel first in me that the love, more or less, which I
have to such persons is for God; and that in the reason why I love them more, God appears.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second: I want to set before me a man whom I have never seen or known,
and desiring all his perfection in the ministry and condition which he has, as I would want him to
keep the mean in his manner of distributing, for the greater glory of God our Lord and the greater
perfection of his soul; I, doing so, neither more nor less, will keep the rule and measure which I
should want and judge to be right for the other.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third: I want to consider, as if I were at the point of death, the form and measure
which then I should want to have kept in the office of my administration, and regulating myself by
that, to keep it in the acts of my distribution</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Rule.</b> The fourth: Looking how I shall find myself on the Day of Judgment, to think
well how then I should want to have used this office and charge of administration; and the rule
which then I should want to have kept, to keep it now.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Rule.</b> The fifth: When some person feels himself inclined and drawn to some persons to
whom he wants to distribute alms, let him hold himself back and ponder well the above-mentioned
four Rules, examining and testing his affection by them; and not give the alms until, conformably
to them, he has in all dismissed and cast out his disordered inclination.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Rule.</b> The sixth: Although there is no fault in taking the goods of God our Lord to distribute
them, when the person is called by God our Lord to such ministry; still in the quantity of what he
has to take and apply to himself out of what he has to give to others, there may be doubt as to fault
and excess. Therefore, he can reform in his life and condition by the above-mentioned Rules.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Rule.</b> The seventh: For the reasons already mentioned and for many others, it is always
better and more secure in what touches one’s person and condition of life to spare more and diminish
and approach more to our High Priest, our model and rule, who is Christ our Lord; conformably
to what the third Council of Carthage, in which St. Augustine was, determines and orders—that
the furniture of the Bishop be cheap and poor. The same should be considered in all manners of
life, looking at and deciding according to the condition and state of the persons; as in married life
we have the example of St. Joachim and of St. Ann, who, dividing their means into three parts,
gave the first to the poor, and the second to the ministry and service of the Temple, and took the
third for the support of themselves and of their household.</p>\n

        THE FOLLOWING NOTES HELP TO PERCEIVE AND UNDERSTAND SCRUPLES\n
        AND PERSUASIONS OF OUR ENEMY\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_rules_four_content">
        <b>First Note.</b> The first: They commonly call a scruple what proceeds from our own judgment and freedom: that is to say,
        when I freely decide that that is sin which is not sin, as when it happens that after some one has accidentally stepped on a
        cross of straw, he decides with his own judgment that he has sinned.\n
        <p>This is properly an erroneous judgment and not a real scruple.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Note.</b> The second: After I have stepped on that cross, or after I have thought or said or
done some other thing, there comes to me a thought from without that I have sinned, and on the
other hand it appears to me that I have not sinned; still I feel disturbance in this; that is to say, in
as much as I doubt and in as much as I do not doubt.</p>\n
        <p>That is a real scruple and temptation which the enemy sets.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Note.</b> Third: The first scruple—of the first note—is much to be abhorred, because it is
all error; but the second—of the second note—for some space of time is of no little profit to the
soul which is giving itself to spiritual exercises; rather in great manner it purifies and cleanses
such a soul, separating it much from all appearance of sin: according to that saying of Gregory: “It
belongs to good minds to see a fault where there is no fault.”</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Note.</b> The fourth: The enemy looks much if a soul is gross or delicate, and if it is
delicate, he tries to make it more delicate in the extreme, to disturb and embarrass it more. For
instance, if he sees that a soul does not consent to either mortal sin or venial or any appearance of
deliberate sin, then the enemy, when he cannot make it fall into a thing that appears sin, aims at
making it make out sin where there is not sin, as in a word or very small thought.</p>\n
        <p>If the soul is gross, the enemy tries to make it more gross; for instance, if before it made no
account of venial sins, he will try to have it make little account of mortal sins, and if before it made
some account, he will try to have it now make much less or none.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Note.</b> The fifth: The soul which desires to benefit itself in the spiritual life, ought always
to proceed the contrary way to what the enemy proceeds; that is to say, if the enemy wants to make
the soul gross, let it aim at making itself delicate. Likewise, if the enemy tries to draw it out to
extreme fineness, let the soul try to establish itself in the mean, in order to quiet itself in everything.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Note.</b> The sixth: When such good soul wants to speak or do something within the Church,
within the understanding of our Superiors, and which should be for the glory of God our Lord, and
there comes to him a thought or temptation from without that he should neither say nor do that
thing—bringing to him apparent reasons of vainglory or of another thing, etc.,—then he ought to
raise his understanding to his Creator and Lord, and if he sees that it is His due service, or at the
least not contrary to it, he ought to act diametrically against such temptation, according to St.
Bernard, answering the same: “Neither for thee did I begin, nor for thee will I stop.”</p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="spe_rules_five_title">TO HAVE THE TRUE SENTIMENT\n WHICH WE OUGHT TO HAVE IN THE CHURCH\n MILITANT</string>

        <string name="spe_rules_five_content">
        Let the following Rules be observed\n
        <p><b>First Rule.</b> The first: All judgment laid aside, we ought to have our mind ready and prompt to
obey, in all, the true Spouse of Christ our Lord, which is our holy Mother the Church Hierarchical.</p>\n
        <p><b>Second Rule.</b> The second: To praise confession to a Priest, and the reception of the most Holy
Sacrament of the Altar once in the year, and much more each month, and much better from week
to week, with the conditions required and due.</p>\n
        <p><b>Third Rule.</b> The third: To praise the hearing of Mass often, likewise hymns, psalms, and long
prayers, in the church and out of it; likewise the hours set at the time fixed for each Divine Office
and for all prayer and all Canonical Hours.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourth Rule.</b> The fourth: To praise much Religious Orders, virginity and continence, and not
so much marriage as any of these.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifth Rule.</b> The fifth: To praise vows of Religion, of obedience, of poverty, of chastity and of
other perfections of supererogation. And it is to be noted that as the vow is about the things which
approach to Evangelical perfection, a vow ought not to be made in the things which withdraw from
it, such as to be a merchant, or to be married, etc.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixth Rule.</b> To praise relics of the Saints, giving veneration to them and praying to the Saints;
and to praise Stations, pilgrimages, Indulgences, pardons, Cruzadas, and candles lighted in the
churches.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventh Rule.</b> To praise Constitutions about fasts and abstinence, as of Lent, Ember Days,
Vigils, Friday and Saturday; likewise penances, not only interior, but also exterior.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eighth Rule.</b> To praise the ornaments and the buildings of churches; likewise images, and to
venerate them according to what they represent.</p>\n
        <p><b>Ninth Rule.</b> Finally, to praise all precepts of the Church, keeping the mind prompt to find
reasons in their defence and in no manner against them.</p>\n
        <p><b>Tenth Rule.</b> We ought to be more prompt to find good and praise as well the Constitutions and
recommendations as the ways of our Superiors. Because, although some are not or have not been
such, to speak against them, whether preaching in public or discoursing before the common people,
would rather give rise to fault-finding and scandal than profit; and so the people would be incensed
against their Superiors, whether temporal or spiritual. So that, as it does harm to speak evil to the
common people of Superiors in their absence, so it can make profit to speak of the evil ways to the
persons themselves who can remedy them.</p>\n
        <p><b>Eleventh Rule.</b> To praise positive and scholastic learning. Because, as it is more proper to the
Positive Doctors, as St. Jerome, St. Augustine and St. Gregory, etc., to move the heart to love and
serve God our Lord in everything; so it is more proper to the Scholastics, as St. Thomas, St. Bonaventure, and to the Master of the Sentences, etc., to define or explain for our times 41 the things
necessary for eternal salvation; and to combat and explain better all errors and all fallacies. For the
Scholastic Doctors, as they are more modern, not only help themselves with the true understanding
of the Sacred Scripture and of the Positive and holy Doctors, but also, they being enlightened and
clarified by the Divine virtue, help themselves by the Councils, Canons and Constitutions of our
holy Mother the Church.</p>\n
        <p><b>Twelfth Rule.</b> We ought to be on our guard in making comparison of those of us who are alive
to the blessed passed away, because error is committed not a little in this; that is to say, in saying,
this one knows more than St. Augustine; he is another, or greater than, St. Francis; he is another
St. Paul in goodness, holiness, etc.</p>\n
        <p><b>Thirteenth Rule.</b> To be right in everything, we ought always to hold that the white which I
see, is black, if the Hierarchical Church so decides it, believing that between Christ our Lord, the
Bridegroom, and the Church, His Bride, there is the same Spirit which governs and directs us for
the salvation of our souls. Because by the same Spirit and our Lord Who gave the ten
Commandments, our holy Mother the Church is directed and governed.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fourteenth Rule.</b> Although there is much truth in the assertion that no one can save himself
without being predestined and without having faith and grace; we must be very cautious in the
manner of speaking and communicating with others about all these things.</p>\n
        <p><b>Fifteenth Rule.</b> We ought not, by way of custom, to speak much of predestination; but if in
some way and at some times one speaks, let him so speak that the common people may not come
into any error, as sometimes happens, saying: Whether I have to be saved or condemned is already
determined, and no other thing can now be, through my doing well or ill; and with this, growing
lazy, they become negligent in the works which lead to the salvation and the spiritual profit of
their souls.</p>\n
        <p><b>Sixteenth Rule.</b> In the same way, we must be on our guard that by talking much and with much
insistence of faith, without any distinction and explanation, occasion be not given to the people to
be lazy and slothful in works, whether before faith is formed in charity or after.</p>\n
        <p><b>Seventeenth Rule.</b> Likewise, we ought not to speak so much with insistence on grace that the
poison of discarding liberty be engendered.</p>\n
        <p>So that of faith and grace one can speak as much as is possible with the Divine help for the
greater praise of His Divine Majesty, but not in such way, nor in such manners, especially in our
so dangerous times, that works and free will receive any harm, or be held for nothing.</p>\n
        <p>Eighteenth Rule. Although serving God our Lord much out of pure love is to be esteemed
above all; we ought to praise much the fear of His Divine Majesty, because not only filial fear is a
thing pious and most holy, but even servile fear—when the man reaches nothing else better or more
useful—helps much to get out of mortal sin. And when he is out, he easily comes to filial fear,
which is all acceptable and grateful to God our Lord: as being at one with the Divine Love.</p>\n

        <p>In asking me to undertake this translation into English of Wiktor Gramatowski’s ‘Glossario’,
        the Director of the Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu, Fr Brian Mac Cuarta SJ, sought to continue his late colleague’s work.
        He wanted to open up the
        Roman Jesuit Archive, especially to the first-time researcher in this area, by way of
        providing definitions and explanations of terms and concepts that are essential to
        comprehending the workings of the archive, and of the Society more broadly. With
        this aim in mind, the English translation that follows is less concerned with precision
        than with meaning, attempting to render clearly and in a straightforward manner the
        key information provided in the original 1992 Italian document, adjusting, updating
        and expanding where possible, especially in parts where further explanation might be
            required for the twenty-first century scholar working in the English language.</p>\n\n

        <p>The translation is historical in approach: that is, like the original ‘Glossario’, it
        provides the meanings of key terms in the sense in which they were used, often at the
        very dawn of the Society; some of these terms still are in use today, and Gramatowski
        was interested also in their contemporary application when he wrote the ‘Glossario’.
        Yet, with many of these terms or categories having fallen into disuse, or differently
        applied since Gramatowski’s day, unlike the Italian version, the overarching interest
        of this translation is to present these terms as they were used in the Old Society (prior
        to its Suppression in 1773), or in the first one-hundred or so years after the Restoration
        of the Society in 1814.</p>\n\n

        <p>Gramatowski’s ‘Glossario’ is more than a research tool for work in the Archives,
        although it is that too. It introduces the researcher to most of the key vocabulary and
        concepts used in the Society of Jesus, most of which had their origins, and often their
        definitions, in the Constitutions. This foundational document (undertaken over several
        years, beginning in 1547, and continued in 1552, then printed in 1558–59), actually
        includes, aside from the Constitutions themselves, the Formula of the Institute (1540,
        revised 1550), the General Examen (c. 1546), The Declarations on the Examen and the
        Constitutions (1559), published together as one volume for the first time in 1570. The
        modern English edition is The Constitutions of the Society of Jesus, trans. George E.
        Ganss (St. Louis: The Institute of Jesuit Sources, 1970). The Index of this edition is
        particularly useful in locating many of the terms and themes contained in the ‘Glossary’</p>\n\n

        <p>Another text regularly referred to throughout the ‘Glossario’ is the Ratio Studiorum
        (1599), the text dedicated to the structure and content of the Jesuit educational
        programme, many of whose features and terms consequently appear here. A modern
        edition in English is Claude Pavur, S.J. The Ratio Studiorum: The Official Plan for
        Jesuit Education (Saint Louis: The Institute of Jesuit Sources, 2005). A further useful
        study of the early years of the Society of Jesus — which contextualises much of the
        material contained in this ‘Glossary’, as well as the Constitutions themselves — is
        John W. O’Malley, The First Jesuits (Cambridge, MA, 1993). This text is
        commended to the reader for the invaluable insights that it provides into early Jesuit
        history.</p>\n\n

        <p>While the above English-language resources are recommended as useful additional
        material for the researcher who consults this ‘Glossary’, the translation that follows
        also retains references, provided throughout Gramatowski’s original version, to the
        three-volume Institutum S.I. (Florence, 1892–3), whose use for the reader is explained
        in the Preface below.</p>\n\n

        <p>Finally, I extend my thanks to the personnel at ARSI, especially Mauro Brunello,
        Nicoletta Basilotta, Francesco Stacca, and most particularly the Director Fr Brian Mac
        Cuarta SJ</p>\n

        <p>After years of work in the Archivum Romanum Societatis Iesu (ARSI),
        I observed that researchers often encounter great difficulty in reading
        our documents on account of the terminology used in them, and the regulations
        and procedures in use at the time they were written, or specific to the Society of Jesus.
        For this reason the ARSI Jesuit Glossary is intended to provide relevant information and
        explanations to facilitate clear and precise comprehension of all documents.</p>\n\n

        <p>Further information has been added that may assist researchers.</p>\n\n

        <p>This modest glossary lists terms in alphabetical order followed by their most common
        abbreviated form, a succinct explanation, and useful suggestions for further
        investigation</p>\n\n

        <p>The most frequent references are made to the Florentine edition of the Institutum S.I.
        of 1892–3 in 3 volumes, cited as Inst. S.I. If nothing further is added, reference is to
        the large Index at the end of volume 3, where it is possible to find further legal and

        <p>Any group that is several hundred years old will develop its own culture, history and vocabulary.
        So the Society of Jesus has inherited, created, and handed on a number of customs, traditons, and practces.
        This booklet is an attempt to gather some of these in alphabetcal order, from A to Z. It could be called Jesuit vocabulary,
        Jesuit-speak, Jesuit literacy, the Jesuit culture, or, as we call it more simply, a Jesuit Dictonary. May it serve as an introduction
        to Jesuit culture, to our ways of proceeding, and to our world view.</p>\n\n

        <p>Of course the items listed vary in importance. Many are humorous, in Latin, coming from a past era.
        Others point to the specific nature and character of the Jesuit mindset. Those included here are part
        of the tradition of the New York Province, but shared by Jesuits around the world in varying degrees.
        Indeed, many of the items listed are not specifically Jesuit, used only by Jesuits, but are part of the
        larger Catholic tradition. But they have found frequent usage in the Society</p>\n\n

        <p>For whom is this helpful? It can help as one is reading a book about Jesuits or by a Jesuit,
        and one runs into a strange word or phrase. It can also be helpful to young Jesuits as they
        hear of the traditions of the “older fathers.” It can be of help to our increasing number
        of lay colleagues or lay collaborators, as we introduce them to our way of proceeding and
        our spirituality.</p>\n\n

        <p>Surely, there are many items omitted, and surely, some could be expanded, modified or improved.
        The compiler is open to suggestions and corrections</p>\n\n

        <string name="a_para34">Academy. An academy was a select grouping of students, which gathered for various activities associated with studies.
        There was an academy for theologians and philosophers, one for rhetoricians and students of the humanities; there was also one for students of grammar.
        Their meeting rooms came to be called ‘the academy’. Inst. S.I., Academiae.</string>

        <string name="a_para35">Academic. This term has two possible meanings: 1) the prefect of an Academy (or academic discipline) in
        the Jesuit colleges (see also, the Ratio Studiorum). 2) An older meaning of the term referred to the priest responsible for
        members of the nobility resident in Jesuit boarding schools, with oversight of their academic progress and of such activities as
        theatrical performances etc. This role was equivalent to that of college Prefects of Studies (often appearing in documents in
        its abbreviated form, Praef. stud.).
        See Inst. S.I., Academiae e Repetentes</string>

        <string name="a_para36">Admission. This term concerns the process of admission into the Society of Jesus.
        Responsibility for the selection of candidates belonged
        to the Provincial. In the cases of candidates who had studied at one of the colleges of the Society (but who were not yet members of it),
        the Jesuit personnel and administrative catalogues sometimes note two stages of admission, e.g.: a) admissus Flexiae, b) ingressus Parisiis.
        This refers to the process by which the Provincial, in making his routine visitations of the colleges, would examine possible candidates, and
        then have them assessed by staff at the college (who knew them best), before admission to the Society.
        Candidates did not enter the novitiate straight away,
        but did so in the months following the initial admission. In Jesuit personnel records, membership of
        the Society is not dated from when this initial admission
        took place, but from the date of entry to the novitiate. See Inst. S.I., Admissio.</string>

        <string name="a_para37">Admonisher. Refers to the Jesuit member who was responsible for communicating
        to a superior on any number of issues — observations, complaints,
        requests, and so forth (often of a delicate nature) — on behalf of his fellow- Jesuits.
        The position was established with a view to assisting the superior and the
        community as a whole, in terms of the quality of its leadership by identifying areas of disagreement, misconduct, or
        other problems that might arise. See, Inst. S.I., vol. 3, p.557.</string>
        <string name="a_para38">Sacristan. The rules for this role can be found in Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 147–9.</string>

        <string name="a_para39">Alienation of goods. This term refers to the transferral, or removal, of goods from the Jesuit property to which they pertained.
        The Society established prohibitions against the separation of significant goods from the property to which they belonged, specifying that permission
        to do so must be granted by the Holy See. In making its decision, the papacy was to be informed about the nature of the goods, and the scope of the sales,
        etc. See also, Inst. S.I.: Bona</string>
        <string name="a_para40">Secretary or clerk. This was a writer engaged in the transcription of texts, especially Latin documents,
        a task normally undertaken by an ordained Jesuit. See Inst. S.I., vol 2, p.74.</string>
        <string name="a_para41">Annual letters. These were the annual epistolary reports sent to Rome by way of each Provincial in the Society.
        They were sent from Jesuit houses or missions, in the form of a summary of activities undertaken during the year.
        For the many published annual letters, see the ARSI library catalogue entries, Annuae Litterae and Lettere or Lettera.
        On the prescribed method for writing the Annual Letters, see Inst. S.I. vol 3, Formula scribendi, numbers 26–31.</string>
        <string name="a_para42">Year. The term appears regularly in the Society’s personnel catalogues.
        The method used for counting years in the sixteenth- to eighteenth centuries was quite inconsistent.
        In most cases, months were not counted, e.g.: ‘natus 21 nov. 1595, defunctus 5 apr. 1660 = 65 annorum’
        (‘born 21 November 1595, died 5 April 1660 = 65 years’).</string>
        <string name="a_para43">Application. This term refers to the province in which a Jesuit was admitted to the Society, normally
        the place where his novitiate was located; however, it could also refer to his province of origin (in times of expulsion or persecution),
        with the novitiate actually being located elsewhere. If a Jesuit was sent (referred to as ‘applicato/applied’) to a different province
        from his original one for an extended period, then this was noted in a designated list at the end of the annual catalogue, thus:
        Ex hac Provincia iverunt [From this Province they went], or In hanc Provinciam venerunt [they came into this Province].
        From that point onwards, his name should be sought in the catalogue of the province to which he was sent (‘applicato’).
        This should be kept in mind in cases where the name of an individual — not deceased — ceases to appear in the standard catalogue lists.
        See Inst. S.I.: Applicatio.</string>
        <string name="a_para44">Founded in 1932, this is the journal of Jesuit history published every six months at Rome

        including acts concerning the Society’s founding and the General Congregations, the Superior Generals’ government,
        correspondence with the Provinces, etc. The archive’s holdings are arranged geographically according to the Assistancies
        and Provinces of the Society, and chronologically within the Provinces. The Provinces maintain their own archives and do
        not transfer their documents to Rome. The Inventories should be consulted for each section. For the Fondo Gesuitico,
        see the relevant entry, below. See, Inst. S.I.: Archivium.</string>
        <string name="a_para46">Hermitage. The term was used sometimes to refer to the place where the Spiritual Exercises were
        undertaken, whether individual or collective. More commonly it is called the Domus Exercitiorum [House of the Exercises,
        or retreat house]. Prior to the creation of specially designated houses, the Exercises were conducted for individuals
        or small groups in rooms set aside for this purpose in the Jesuit houses or colleges. See, I. Iparraguirre, Historia de
        los Ejercicios de San Ignacio, vols I, II, III (to end of the eighteenth century).</string>

        Hispaniae, Lusitaniae, Galliae, Poloniae). The Assistant does not have any jurisdiction, but his knowledge and personality
        afford him a significant role in assisting with the General’s leadership of the Society.
        He is appointed for an unlimited period, until the death of the General. If he dies or retires before the General, it is the General’s
        responsibility to nominate one or more names to the Provincials, a majority of whom must then approve the new candidate, before
        he takes up the role. See, Inst. S.I.: Assistentes.</string>

        mendicant religious orders that prevented another order from opening a house, church or oratory
        at less than 140 canne — or in some cases, less than 300 canne — distance from an existing convent.
        The ‘canna’ was an ancient measuring unit, equivalent to 2.23 metres (in Rome), but it varied from one city to another.
        Accordingly, the distance reserved to the mendicant orders could vary from 312 to 670 metres. Tensions often ran high
        around these rules and charges were often made that some religious orders obtained papal privilege to establish
        themselves where they wanted, without taking account of nearby convents’ privileges. For its part,
        the Society of Jesus secured a licence from Pius IV (Etsi ex debito, 1561) and from Gregory XIII (Salvatoris Domini, 1576)
        to erect or acquire buildings at less than 140 canne distance from mendicant convents. This privilege was declared
        non-transferable [non comunicabile]. See, Inst. S.I.: Cannae.</string>
        <string name="c_para46">Professor who expounded cases of conscience. The regulations contained in
        the Ratio Studiorum (Inst. S.I. vol. 3, pp. 188–9) define this role as entailing the preparation
        of priests for the administration of the sacraments, especially that of penance. The role mainly
        involved teaching through examples or cases of conscience. For those priests who had finished their
        training, all of the important communities had collationes casuum conscientiae, conferences at which
        a designated leader, praefectus or praeses casuum, presided. See, Inst. S.I.: Casus Conscientiae</string>

        <string name="c_para47">
        Catalogues. From very early after the Society’s foundation, Provincials were required to send to Rome a personnel list, or Catalogus brevis,
        for each house towards the end of each year. The date on which the list is drawn up is identified in a number of ways:\n
        a) lucalibus, around 18 October, the liturgical feast of Saint Luke and the beginning of the academic year;\n
        b) exeunte anno, at the end of the calendar year;\n
        c) ineunte anno, at the beginning of the year. Abbreviations used in these lists are explained in this glossary,
        under the corresponding entry: admonitor, etc., and at the end of this document.
        In many cases the catalogues contain complementary lists at the end: those deceased during the year,
        members from outside the Province, those dismissed, etc.\n
        The Triennale catalogue, which provides information on the career and demeanour of individual members, and on
        the material state of the houses, has three parts: the Primus indicates\n
        a) general information about each member:
        name, surname, age, state of health, length of time in religious life, studies undertaken extra Societatem = before entry to the Society;\n
        b) studies in the Society;\n
        c) ministeria = ministries undertaken and their duration, stage reached at university, religious grade, and date of final vows.\n
        <p>The provenance listed for each member generally refers to his diocese, and not always
        his city or place of birth.</p>\n
        <p>The Secundus, reserved exclusively for the Provincial and the Superior General, deals
        especially with the nomination of superiors, providing an assessment of each member’s
        talents: intelligence, judgment, discernment, experience, temperament, and attitudes.
        Despite being signed by the Provincial, generally the catalogue in fact was compiled by
        the local superior. Its use requires critical judgment and discernment. The Tertius
        describes the income and expenditure of every house. The old Formula scribendi (Inst.
        S.I. vol 3, p.45 n. 34) mentions that the Catalogus Tertius commonly is called the
        Catalogus brevis or annuus.</p>\n

        but the chronological order is not very well maintained: a number of volumes refer to the same period.
        The censors, or revisores generales, residing at the Collegio Romano, already were active from the beginning
        of the seventeenth century. The role evolved such that there were four or five censors, one for each Assistancy.
        In some cases, their view was given collegialiter, that is, their decisions were given more weight by
        being signed by three or four censors, not just one. Inst. S.I.: Censura librorum, Revisores.

        <string name="c_para51">Coadjutors: literally, ‘helpers’. This was one of the grades in the Society’s membership that was instituted by Ignatius.
        The role of coadjutor has changed over time, but prior to the modern era, they commonly assisted the professed member; the professed were assigned
        the main roles whether in priestly ministry or in governance. The Society established two types of coadjutor:\n
        <p>1) the Coadiutores spirituales [spiritual coadjutors] were defined as priests that
        undertook a reduced programme in Jesuit formation studies; they received a
        practical preparation for hearing confessions and, upon completing their
        formation, engaged in less senior ministries than fully professed Jesuits.</p>\n
        <p>2) Coadiutores temporales [temporal coadjutors] were established as lay
        religious called Fratres, or brother coadjutors. With the exception of
        governance roles, they could hold all positions that did not pertain to the
        priesthood, for example offices of procurators and administrators. In the main,
        they traditionally provided domestic service; however, if they were talented in
        certain fields, they could practise in the arts (such as painting, or engraving),
        and also teach in elementary school. See Inst. S.I.: Coadiutores.</p>\n

        <string name="c_para52">
        <p>College. Since the word signifies \‘group of people that carries
        out the same office together\’, it applied to non-teaching communities as well as
        academic ones. For example, the college of the Penitenzieri di S. Pietro in Rome, and
        that of Loreto, were communities of confessors attached to the respective sanctuaries.
        Also, the colleges of Rome, such as the Germanico, English College, etc. were boarding
        institutions for ecclesiastical students entrusted to the Society of Jesus for their spiritual
        formation; these students attended the Roman College for their intellectual training,
        receiving a certain amount of further support in their respective houses, provided by
        tutors who helped the students with revision for their courses.
        Similar colleges existed in other locations.</p>\n
        <p>In terms of the ordinary meaning of Collegium — as a teaching institution — the
        majority of Jesuit colleges consisted of second level schools only concerned with
        literary studies, including rhetoric. Broadly, Jesuit teaching colleges can be
        distinguished thus:</p>\n
        <p>a)Collegium Nostrorum (Coll. NN. \‘College of Ours\’): reserved for Jesuit
    students, in contrast with Collegium externorum (which included non-Jesuit students);
    however, this was not a distinction that was used in the Society prior to its Suppression
    in 1773. The students, or \‘scholastics\’ often lived in some larger colleges open to
    external students, according to the form that the typical \‘college\’ took almost
    immediately after the Society\’s founding.</p>\n
        <p>b)
Collegium universitatis (University College): in which higher-level teaching
was provided. Even without the added \‘universitatis\’, all of the large colleges had a
course in philosophy over two or three years, and one in theology over four years.</p>\n
        <p>c)
Collegium inchoatum [elementary college]: that of initial foundation. Generally
the first classes of grammar were offered here. The name residentia was given to the
college building as well.</p>\n
        <p>When a prospective college\’s financial foundations were deemed sufficient, new classes
        were introduced and these institutions came to be referred to as colleges. See
        Seminarium, Convictus, below. The superior of the college received the title of rector.
        He was assisted by a praefectus studiorum (prefect of studies or scholarum) an
        inferiorum (junior prefect) and, when required, by a praefectus studiorum superiorum
        (prefect of upper-level studies). In missionary lands (China, Japan etc.) the term could
        indicate simply a house that had a financial foundation and was characterised as a
        College without reference to an educational role. See, Inst. S.I.: Collegia. See also A.
        Hamy, Documents pour servir à l\'histoire des domiciles de la Compagnie de Jésus dans
        le monde entier de 1540 à 1773 (Paris,1890).</p>\n
    </string>
        <string name="c_para53">Commission: received as a mandate.</string>
        <string name="c_para54">Preacher. This was a general title given to preachers.
        With the addition of the terms, in templo nostro (in our temple), or per annum (during the year),
        the scope of a preacher’s activities was further defined: in the first instance, restricted to the
        church of a Jesuit college or residence, and in the second instance limited to the delivery of
        sermons in the ordinary time of the Church year only (and not Advent and Lent). The Concionator in
        platea (street preacher) was responsible for public preaching in open spaces. This was a very active
        apostolate in the past, since some public squares were gathering places for people seeking work, so
        that public preachers would speak to the waiting crowd. See, Inst. S.I.: Concionatores, Concionari.</string>
        <string name="c_para55">Confessor. The Jesuit personnel catalogues note with precision the scope of the
        role. Conf. in nostro templo: in our church = principal office of confessor, requiring that he be available
        full-time in the college or house. Conf. NN = Nostrorum, that is, confessor of the religious in the community.
        Conf. Sod. = confessor to the various congregations (sodalities), including students, or
        externals. Conf. conv. = confessor of school boarders, etc. Conf. ad ianuam refers to confessors
        whose task was to respond to the call of those who presented themselves at a Jesuit residence for
        confession. See, Inst. S.I.: Confessio.</string>

        <string name="c_para56">Congregation. The meaning of this term is equivalent to the chapter (or meeting)
        in other orders. There are four kinds:\n
        <p>a)
        Generalis (General): without a fixed date. It gathers with the right to elect the
        Superior General (or a Vicar General with right of succession); and also, although rare,
        it can be held by convocation of the Superior General or by a decision of the
        Congregation</p>\n
        <p>b)
Procuratorum (Congregation of procurators): this was established by the
second General Congregation in 1565 and held every three years thereafter. Every
Province elects a procurator (see below), who, with the other procurators, votes in
Rome on whether or not to convene the General Congregation. The Provincials, plus
two professed members (those with the four vows) elected from each Province, take
part in this process. For the elections, the Provincial Congregation is called.</p>\n
        <p>a)
Provinciae (Province). This congregation was composed of the superiors of the
principal houses and of a certain number of Professed, in order of age. This
Congregation also votes — not binding — on whether or not to convoke the General
Congregation, and draws up requests (Postulata) for that Congregation (or for the
General);</p>\n
        <p>b)
ad eligendum Vicarium temporarium [for the election of a temporary Vicar].
See Inst. S.I.: Congregatio, Formula.</p>\n
        <p>A second use of the term congregatio was in reference to the various Jesuit sodalities.
For example, the Marian sodality was an association of the Christian life directed by a
Pater [father] or Praefectus Congregationis [prefect of the congregation]. The
congregations were based in Jesuit houses. Each one brought together members of
different kinds: students, old or young, externals or school boarders; the middling ranks
or the nobility (cives, nobiles); artisans (artifices) or priests, etc. Also, there was the
Congregatio Bonae Mortis (see above); it was directed by a Praedicator (preacher),
esortatore (exhorter), prefect, or director. They gathered weekly. See, E. Mullan, La
Congregazione Mariana studiata nei documenti (Roma, 1911).</p>\n
    </string>
        <string name="c_para57">Customs. The term refers to practices concerning communal life in every Province;
        the timetables, dress codes etc. were recorded in a ‘Book of Practices’ subject to the approval of the General.
        ARSI holds a number of these texts. See Inst. S.I.: Consuetudines.</string>
        <string name="c_para58">see Consultores.</string>
        <string name="c_para59">counsellors (known as ‘consultors’ in English) from within his own community are
        assigned to every superior, by his own superior. They are: the ‘Assistants’ of the Superior General,
        chosen by the General Congregation (see Assistens); the counsellors of the Provincials (Consultores Provinciae), nominated by the General;
        those of the local superiors, nominated by the Provincial (Consultores domus), who do not have decision-making power,
        but the superior must listen to them about all important matters arising in relation to his position.
        The guidelines for the counsellors’ role can be viewed in the Institutum S.I. Counsellors write to the
        General every year about the progress of the house or of the Province. In the main, the General thanks
        the consultors of houses through one of their number. Summaries or extracts of their letters and other
        relevant information were produced in the form of suggestions, and sent to Provincials: Excerpta ex iis,
        quae referuntur. Often the General takes account of such information to seek further explanations on
        particular matters or to give directives, ‘si vera sunt ea quae dicuntur’. Consultors also can be appointed
        for specific tasks, for example: for temporal administration (‘de re temporali’), ‘ad graviora’. See Inst. S.I.,
        Consultationes, Consultores.</string>

        <string name="c_para62">boarding pupils used to live in a part of the college, which was sub- divided in small
        partially-partitioned units (camerata), that is in small groups, generally of the same class, under the
        supervision and with the help of young Jesuits, mostly theologians, when, as happened most frequently the
        boarders were in a city with a large college. Some richer pupils had an individual apartment with tutor and servants.
        The management of the boarding section was entrusted to a Father Primarius. The prefects were called Praefecti cubiculorum.

        while religious who have taken first vows can be dismissed only by the General. For priests and the solemnly professed,
        specific formalities are required. The religious who asks for, and is granted, to be released from his vows is called
        ‘Dimissus petens’; if the dismissal is involuntary, it is ‘ dimissus invitus’. If he abandons the religious
        life without permission, he is fugitivus or apostata a vita religiosa. The list of dimissi during a given year

        <string name="d_para8">some Jesuit houses come to be assigned the name Domus, with the following distinctions:\n1)
        Domus probationis or novitiate, abbreviated to Dom. prob., where novices usually spend two years before taking their religious vows.
        The Third Probation year (called \'tertianship\' in English) (see Probatio) is undertaken in a Domus Probationis as well, although
        possibly different from that of the novitiate.\n2) Domus professa or professorum: the professed house is a residence for formed
        religious who are assigned to apostolic ministries. It is distinct from the other residences by being subject to a particular form of
        poverty: it is prohibited from possessing any fixed income, and has to be sustained through charitable donations. There were few of
        these houses, and they tended to be established in the large cities. The first professed house of the Society was the Roman residence
        of the Superior General (abbreviation: Dom. Prof. Rom.), which was located at the Gesù church until the suppression of the Society in
        1773; and again from 1814 to 1873.\n</string>

        present for the individual prayer of reflection (examen) held each day for a quarter of
        an hour at midday and in the evening. The Examen generale is described thus: Primum ac generale examen
        iis omnibus qui in Societatem Iesu admitti petent proponendum [First and general inquiry to be proposed
        to all those asking to be admitted to the Society of Jesus]. The text, by Saint Ignatius, is located at
        the beginning of the Constitutions. The term \'examen\' also refers to the specific inquiries undertaken
        for each of the various types of candidates to the Society, for which see, Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 1–23.
        Finally, the Examen ad gradum refers to the general exam on doctrine that takes place at the end of the
        philosophical and theological cycle of studies; it lasts at least two hours and must be passed in front

        <string name="g_para15">in the type of document known as the First Triennial Catalogue, the term is used in the following ways:\n
        1)Gradus in litteris and\n
        2)Gradus in Societate.\n
        <p>The first term, Gradus in litteris, refers to the academic rank of members. Generally,
        seeking academic rank unnecessarily is discouraged in the Society (on which point,
        see Inst. S.I., vol 1, p.35; vol 2, p.66). However, in some faculties entrusted to the
        Jesuits — for example, at Bourges, Pont-a-Mousson — official ranks were conferred
        on professors that corresponded to their teaching role. In such cases, the relevant
        academic rank was recorded in the catalogues. The term Gradus in Societate, instead,
        refers to different grades of membership among the religious of the Society. This
        system was established by Saint lgnatius in a specific historical context that was very
        different from our own times (See Inst. S.l., Index: Gradus in Societate). The conferral
        of these grades occupies an important place in the correspondence between the
        Provincials and the General. Some volumes at ARSI are entitled De promovendis (see,
        Gall. 40, Hisp. 87, etc.), and the ordinary correspondence mentions the subject often
        (See also: Professi, Vota). Also some assessments of the examiners ‘ad gradum’ have
        been preserved, for example, Ital. 167.</p>\n

        <string name="g_para16">in general the term refers to the three levels at which grammar was taught: elementary,
        intermediate, advanced (see Inst. S.l., Ratio studiorum inferiorum). The progressive nature of the subject\'s study — at

        where, after the humanities, the grammar classes are listed in a descending order, although this arrangement varied according to region and period.
        In the main, the teachers progressed, like their students, from elementary, to intermediate, and then to advanced grammar classes.

        1) in its broadest sense, the term refers to every task entrusted to members by the Pope or by a Superior
        (and is the underlying principle of the Fourth Vow of professed members: ‘insuper promitto specialem obedientiam Summo Pontifici circa missiones...’ ‘in
        omnibus quae iusserit Summus Pontifex et quocumque miserit, etc.’, on which see the Constitutions V, Ill, 3 and C).\n
        2) Most commonly, the term is used to describe the apostolic missions undertaken among unconverted peoples, or Christian populations.
        The missions ‘ad paganos’ were part of the terminology relating to the ‘East and West Indies’. In this sense, anyone seeking to be sent
        to the overseas missions is called ‘indipeta’ (petitioner for the Indies). The missions were organised into Provinces, the recruitment for
        which was the sole responsibility of the General. However, in selecting candidates from among the various European nations, the General had to
        pay careful attention to political and national considerations. In the early years, Portugal held sway over India, Japan, China and Brazil,
        while Spain influenced the missions in the Americas and the Philippines. In the seventeenth century France extended its influence over Canada
        and the lesser Antilles, as well as in the East, especially Syria, Persia, India, Indochina, and China.
        Jesuits from the German speaking lands were sent to a variety of destinations. In lands where Protestantism dominated, such as England, Ireland,
        Scotland, and the Netherlands, the religious persecutions of the Catholic community (they were generally a minority) meant that
        they were considered missionary destinations. This was the case also for Ottoman territories (eg the Balkans, Turkey, the Levant).
        This is why terms such as ‘Missio Hollandica’ were used.\n
        3)The term also describes Missions undertaken in Catholic lands either
        periodically, or in exceptional circumstances. They were supported by foundations
        and came into use in the seventeenth century. Accounts of these missions can be found
        in various locations at ARSI: some constitute discrete volumes, others are part of the
        annual letters (lettere annue), while others are singly dispersed in the archive.\n
        4)‘Missio’ also is used to describe a group of Jesuits (usually two in number)
        established in a base in a certain location for specific purposes, which, however, is not
        defined as a religious house. In the German Assistancy, there were ‘missiones
        castrenses’, (missions in military camps), which could take place in peace or war, and
        where Jesuits worked as military chaplains. See Inst. S.I..: Missionarii, Missiones.

        seventeenth century so many female religious superiors made requests to have the Spiritual Exercises preached by a

        (Novitii Coadiutores) (also known as ‘brother novices’). There are special provisions for novices
        (see Inst. S.I., v ol 3, pp. 663–5). The novitiate
        lasts for two years, but the second year can be supplemented with studies; this phase is called
        the ‘second probation‘ to distinguish it from the initial,
        and brief, ‘first probation‘. See Inst. S.I.: Probatio.</string>

        See Inst. S.I., vol 1, p.54. In the catalogues (records produced regularly about every member of the Society),
        the only sign that an ordination had taken place was the appearance of the letter ‘P’ (Pater; Father)
        in front of the surname. From 1568 to 1573, Pius V (pope 1566–72) forbade the ordination of nonprofessed
        religious (this had been the Jesuit system, since they were ordained first and then went on to full profession later):
        in this period, instead of full ordination at the usual time in the Society, ordinands made the three vows
        (poverty, chastity, obedience), which didn’t prevent the taking of the 4 vows later. Gregory XIII (pope 1572–85)

        The term tends not to be used in relation to the Provincial: for this reason, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between these two
        offices when reading the Generals’ registers, since it is not clear from their abbreviated forms to which office holder the document refers: the
        letters P. or Pr. placed before or after the name of a correspondent may refer either to the Provincial or the Superior (Praepositus) of
        the professed house. See Inst. S.I., vol 3, p.680. Note, too, that the Superior of the professed house in Rome is known as the ‘vicepraepositus’,

        <string name="p_para51">privilege. A privilege is a ‘lex privata continens beneficium particulare [a private law containing a specific benefit’].
        In the pre-modern period religious orders regularly secured special ‘exemptions’ from a variety of obligations under secular or ecclesiastical law.
        Such privileges and exemptions were a perpetual source of discord. The Index of the Inst. S.I, vol 3, pp. 681–2, provides some indication of
        the scope of the issue for the Society. The archive of the Procurator General contains a large part of the relevant Instrumenta (documentation),
        including indices, especially for Italy.</string>

        <string name="p_para52">
        in the first probation a general examen (or inquiry) is undertaken (see Examen 1), that is, the candidate is introduced to the Society and
        vice versa, usually for a period of 12–21 days, with the period often reduced in cases where the candidate is known to the Society already.
        The examen usually consists of a form of the Spiritual Exercises, entailing a dialogue with examiners appointed by the Provincial.
        The second probation is the novitiate of two years (see above: Novitii). The third probation was introduced by Ignatius: before their
        definitive integration into the Society, Jesuits were required to undertake a third year of the novitiate, intended for spiritual renewal
        after the many years of study, and in order to deepen the member’s knowledge of the foundational documents of the Society. See Inst. S.I, vol 3, p.683.</string>

        <string name="p_para53">this title is used for a number of roles in the Society. The most important is the Procurator General: appointed by
        the Superior General, his office entails oversight of the administrative, legal, and economic affairs of the whole Society.
        See Inst. S.I, vol 2, p.140. In addition, every Province has its own Procurator, also called Bursar [or treasurer]. Furthermore,
        the title of Procurator in Urbe (City Procurator) is given to a resident college treasurer to distinguish this role in cases where there
        is also a Procurator ad res rusticas (rural procurator), whose duties entailed oversight of properties located outside the city.
        The term Procurator is used also to describe those members who are sent from each Province to participate in the triennial Congregations
        of Procurators (see Congregatio, 2). In terms of the usual requirement for attendance at these Congregations, special arrangements had to
        be introduced for those Procurators of Provinces located outside Europe. The Inst. S.I, vol. 3, pp. 684–6 reveals the complexity of this role.
        Another type of Procurator was those representatives of an Assistancy based in the General House or in the overseas Provinces that belonged to
        another Province, and who worked on behalf of that Province’s interests. This was a permanent role, as was that in each house. It is worth noting,
        finally, that the Procurator General as in other Orders also had responsibility for liaising with the Roman Curia (the Papal Curia).</string>

        <string name="p_para54">in the Society of Jesus, ‘professed’ members were those priests who were admitted to take the three solemn vows of poverty,
        chastity, and obedience. The equally solemn fourth vow, further, was taken by some professed members: this was a vow of special obedience to the
        Pope, and it included the possibility of being sent on ‘missions’ wherever the Pope might choose to send them, and where there might be a particular
        need (see above: Missioni). These members are known as ‘professed with four vows.’ In the first decades of the Society, some were granted
        a special privilege to make the solemn profession of four vows without having all of the requirements for doing so, although this was
        very rare after the early period. A certain number of professed members made up the Provincial Congregations, which were organised according to seniority.
        Many senior positions in the Society required the holder to be a professed member. See Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 686–8: Professi, Professio.</string>

        known as manifestations or examinations of conscience, were envisaged by Ignatius as essential elements in the spiritual and
        practical organisation of the Society. Many of the Society’s records contain numerous directives and reflections concerning

        study in the Society, including after the Society’s restoration in 1814 (ending its period of suppression by the papacy
        as a religious order in 1773). The text is contained in Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 158–234; see also Inst. S.I, vol 3, p.694
        and, in the same, the entry Studia at pages 716–17.</string>
        <string name="r_para19">The title of rector in the Society is borrowed from the same term used in universities.
        It refers to those Jesuits who were superiors of colleges and universities. The nature of this role, and its
        particularly broad scope, reflects the hierarchical and monarchical structure of the Society that is set out
        in the Constitutions. See Inst. S.I, vol 3, pp. 108–15; 695–6.</string>
        <string name="r_para20">This term refers to the ‘Director’ of a Seminary that has been entrusted to the Society,
        but does not belong to the Society; Jesuits in this role are called ‘Rector’. See, for this distinction, Mario
        Colpo and Wiktor Gramatowski, ‘I Gesuiti nell’assedio di Vienna del 1683’, AHSI (1983), p. 297.</string>
        <string name="r_para21">These are the norms intended to guide each Jesuit’s conduct. Even though Saint Ignatius’s
        vision for the Society was based on deeply spiritual principles, he also concerned himself with the small
        details of everyday life, and some of these norms were written in his own hand. His successors completed
        this work by devising a set of directives for all members (Regulae communes), as well as rules specifically
        for various Jesuit roles, and for occasions or events that took place regularly in the Society. There are
        specific regulations, for example, relating to priests, confessors, coadjutor brothers, those on travelling
        assignments, the Provincial, and the master of novices. There are directives also relating to the practical
        aspects of certain roles, such as for librarians, sacrestans, and porters. See, A. Coemans, Breves notitiae
        de Instituto... Chapter 2, article IX, Regulae. Ed. 2 Brussels, 1937. The last edition was completed and
        updated in 1963. See, Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 697–8.</string>
        <string name="r_para22">Renewal. From the beginning of the Society, Ignatius envisaged vows as being renewed
        periodically throughout the period of Jesuit formation, until full profession into the Society.
        The practice was the subject of specific guidelines, for which see Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 698–9.
        The original texts for the renewal of simple vows are still extant from the early years of the
        Society (1543–48).</string>
        <string name="r_para23">This term relating to members’ programme of studies is used in the catalogues in two main senses:
        1) to identify those members who were undertaking studies other than philosophy or theology, beyond the usual curriculum.
        On occasion these Repetentes also had the role of prefects of boys in boarding schools 2) to describe those students who,
        having finished a course of studies (literature, theology, etc), are singled out for undertaking a course
        of specialisation in one of them, with a view to teaching. In Poland, these students were called academics.
        See Inst. S.I., vol 3, p.699.</string>

        <string name="r_para24">
        The term is used in a variety of ways.\n
        1) After the reinstatement of the Society in 1814 (following its papal suppression
        as a religious order in 1773) — when the colleges were in the process of being
        re-founded — groups of men involved largely in pastoral work (‘operari’) who
        resided together outside the colleges.\n
        2) Residentiae also was the temporary title given to houses that had not yet
        acquired the status of a regular college; while the process was underway, these
        residences functioned in a similar way to that described above.\n
        3) In the overseas missions Jesuit houses also were called residentiae. See Inst.

        one Jesuit for each Assistancy (the Assistancies were administrative units organised along geo-political

        <string name="s_para35">The Jesuit archive holds a number of documents bearing various seals.
        In the main, the seals are those of specific roles and houses in the Society that required their use in correspondence.
        The letters sent from individual members of the Society normally carried the seal of the Superior. Instead, those Jesuits
        whose role required an individual seal used a small one with just the IHS monogram.
        As for the related term Sigillo volante, this is not a technical term, but instead likely refers to the seal of itinerant Jesuits, such as
        the confessor to the Emperor, who was required to travel frequently in his role. [Translator’s note: the 1840 Vocabolario della lingua
        italiana provides the following: ‘this term is used to describe letters that were sealed only on the outside fold of the letter, so
        that others could read the letter a suo talento’] See also, the entry for Pieghetta, above, and Inst. S.I.: Sigillum. The seal composed
        and used by Ignatius is preserved at ARSI. See also, E. Lamalle’s entry in Dizionario degli Istituti di Perfezione,
        VIII, Roma 1988, coll. 1484–6.</string>

        <string name="s_para36">Seminaries are institutions dedicated to the formation of future priests.
        The term is used in a number of different ways in the context of the Society of Jesus, listed here in four main categories:
        1) Jesuit Seminaries included studies in the Humanities and Rhetoric, Philosophy,
        and Theology. Every Province had one or two main colleges, where young
        Jesuits gathered for such studies. Originally, the colleges were conceived of
        almost as seminaries for the Society. From this foundation, the colleges acquired
        much broader educational roles, including for non-Jesuits, with many acquiring
        the status of universities. For these institutions in their earliest
        conceptualisation, see the relevant section in Inst. S.I., vol 3, p.710.\n
        2) The Council of Trent (1545–63) decreed that seminaries be established for the
        training of all diocesan clergy in the church. After the Society accepted
        responsibility for the Roman Seminary in 1564, it was decided a year later at its
        second General Congregation (1565) that it would not continue this apostolate,
        with the exceptions of the Roman Seminary and (in the early years) that of
        Milan; an exception to this policy was granted also for France. It should be noted
        that famous colleges in Rome such as the German College, the English College
        etc. were seminaries.\n
        3) The term also refers to seminaries in the overseas missions, and\n
        4) to Apostolic (Pontifical) Seminaries in northern Europe, for disadvantaged
        students.\n
    </string>

        <string name="s_para37">
        Companion, associate. This term is used in relation to three roles in the Society:\n
        1) the Associate or Assistant to Provincial. This is an important role, nominated by the Superior General.
        A description of the role can be found at Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 712–13, and 89–93.\n
        2) Socius Magistri Novitiorum: the Associate to the Master of Novices works on the practical matters
        relating to the life of the novitiate and the needs of the novices.\n
        3) Socius exeuntium: this term relates to the requirement in the past
        that a Jesuit leaving his residence should always be in the company of
        another member of the Society. The role of this ‘\Companion of those going out’\
        usually was entrusted to a brother coadjutor. But this requirement was difficult to implement in practice.
        There are various directives relating to the subject (Inst. S.I., vol 3, p.712),
        which was considered especially important for maintaining the good reputation of
        the Society, in line with the social values of the day.\n</string>

        <string name="s_para38">The Marian Sodalities or Confraternities were the main vehicle for lay spiritual formation,
        both inside and beyond the colleges. The assignment of a Jesuit to care for these Marian Congregations can be found
        in the Society’s annual Catalogues; they specify the year group in question in the case of the colleges, and the
        social rank to be targeted for those outside the colleges. See E. Mullan, La Congregazione Mariana studiata nei documenti,
        Roma 1911; Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 717– 18.</string>

        the General’s register of correspondence, in accordance with the period’s official letter-writing practices. See Inst. S.I., vol 3, p.718.</string>

        <string name="s_para40">The role of Superior [or designated leader] is given a great deal of attention
        in the Institutes: Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 720–5. In this text, see also the relevant subtitles
        concerning the role, such as Duratio muneris (duration of the office): this aspect of the superior’s
        position was regulated differently by various popes. Some imposed a rotation of the role every
        three years (imposed by Clement VIII, from 1594 to 1606, and by Innocent X and Alexander VII, from 1646 al 1663).
        Other popes left to the Superior General the freedom, established by Ignatius, to define the
        role’s terms (Constitutions IX, III, 14 and lett. I).
        In the main, the threeyearly rotation of the Superior was the most common practice in the
        seventeenth- and eighteenth centuries.</string>
        <string name="s_para41">Summary. Since the Society’s earliest decades, this name has been given to
        the collection of explanatory passages produced to accompany the Constitutions, entitled the Summary

        sometimes quoted using merely the number (eg ‘the 11 th of the Summary’) See also, A. Coemans, Breves

        Ratio studiorum (Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 178–87), and Inst. S.I., vol 3, pp. 726–8. This system of theology, known as Thomism or scholastic theology
        is known for its rational exploration of matters relating to faith and the divine; it is distinct from ‘positive’ theology — associated with the
        Church Fathers and the Councils — which describes the divine nature according to ‘positive’ categories. It is distinct, too, from ‘moral’ theology,

        2) After the death of a General, a Vicarius temporarius would be appointed, either
        according to the deceased General’s wishes, or else through election by the professed
        members in Rome.\n
        3) In certain circumstances, a General Congregation could elect a Vicar General
        while the Superior General was still living (for example, in cases of a General’s illness).
        The office could be conferred cum iure successionis (with the right of succession) or

        Superior General (except for any areas that the General continues to reserve for himself,
        or are limited by stipulation of the Congregation). With the right of succession, the

        <string name="tp_intro_para">The text that is presented in these pages has been variously entitled: the Acts,
        the Testament, the Story, the Memoirs, or more commonly, the Autobiography of Ignatius of Loyola;
        for it is a personal account of his life.\n
        However, it covers only one period—from the time of his conversion, when he left his ancestral
        home of Loyola, till after many wanderings he finally settled down in Rome and became the first
        Superior General of the Society of Jesus.\n
        No matter what the name, this is an untidy narrative, and seems to be just a patchwork of random
        memories ranging from the trivial to the profoundly significant, extracted from a reluctant Ignatius by
        the importunity of devoted friends. He speaks throughout in the third person, about the Pilgrim. That
        was his self-image: a man on a ceaseless quest, always forging ahead; and not at all inclined to look
        back, even as he neared journey’s end.\n
        But Jerome Nadal, his trusted lieutenant, was determined to obtain a testament—a piece of fatherly
        advice, as he explained, such as other Founders of Orders had left to their disciples. What he had in
        mind was not just any kind of pious message, but a thoroughly reliable account of the intimate
        relationship between God and Ignatius. For Nadal firmly believed, and strongly affirmed, that God
        deals with the followers of Ignatius as he dealt with Ignatius himself, and they must respond as he did.
        Hence the importance of having his own statement, a testimony, of what exactly happened. That would
        be a testament indeed. And to produce such a document was truly to found the Society of Jesus, Nadal
        said.\n
        In the language of today, what he and the first Jesuits wanted was an authoritative exposition of the
        Ignatian charism as it should be realized in themselves and all those who came after. And in fact the
        charism does emerge from these Memoirs, and in such a way as to bring to light the coherence of the
        whole work, and even a certain structured arrangement, in spite of its haphazard composition, due to
        the difficult circumstances in which it came into being.\n
        Ignatius had many good reasons for not attempting the task; and when he finally yielded to so many
        earnest requests, he did not actually write anything. He spoke out his story, in bits and pieces, to Luis
        Gonçalvez da Câmara, another loyal companion and a man blessed with a very retentive memory, who
        first listened with great attention, then ran off to make brief notes, and eventually dictated the text—for
        the most part in the Spanish used by Ignatius, though this was not the mother-tongue of either of them;
        and towards the end having to fall back on what passes for Italian in the international community of
        Rome. In a preface, da Câmara describes the tremendous odds against which he had to struggle in order
        to get the whole job completed. Later, Nadal added a Forward, also stressing the difficulties of the
        enterprise.\n
        It is not surprising that the resulting narrative is most unsatisfactory as a piece of literature. What
        does come as a surprise is that after it had been obtained at such cost it was never published, either in
        the original or in translations into modern languages, till the present century. A free Latin version was
        produced very early by Anibal du Coudret, and later printed, but never really circulated. So the facts
        that are recounted were generally known, but not the text itself—for there seems to have been some
        embarrassment about the way Ignatius expresses himself, and possibly some disappointment too.\n
        Today the document is recognized as a spiritual classic, and a masterpiece of self-revelation in its
        very clumsiness. The remarkable renewal in the appreciation and use of the other small but powerful
        Ignatian composition, the Spiritual Exercises, is in large measure due to their current understanding in
        the light of the insights provided by the Memoirs.\n
        What stands out in the whole story is that Ignatius had a veritable genius for loyalty—and almost a
        felt need to be loyal, to find a person or cause that could claim his total devotion. As a young man he is
        constantly getting caught up in unrealistic ambitions, and not even the sobering experience of a
        shattered leg can break the spell that holds him captive. But some accidental reading reveals to him the
        true object of his quest: it is Christ, who alone is worthy of absolute loyalty and can satisfy the loftiest
        aspirations—in a way that is not self-centered but out-going.\n
        In his encounter with Christ, Ignatius experiences loyalty as liberation. This paradox is the closest
        possible approach to a formulation of the Ignatian charism: loyalty is a firm attachment, something that
        binds; but loyalty to Christ is a liberation from all that hampers true and total growth. For through
        intimate union with Christ one comes to share his own experience—the experience that the man Jesus
        had of the Father, of God as Absolute and all else as relative. This is the truth that makes us free.\n
        Looking more closely at the details of the Memoirs and at the sequence of eleven chapters, we see
        the conversion of Ignatius as the discovery of a deeper and hitherto unsuspected level of being, where
        his real self meets the real God in the person of Christ. This triggers a process of transformation,
        dominated by an overwhelming desire to serve the Lord. But he is now firmly rooted in reality and
        cannot indulge in dreams; he must come to some concrete plan, whilst remaining open to other
        possibilities. (Ch. 1)\n
        As the story proceeds, each succeeding situation he faces brings to him an ever clearer realization
        that commitment to Christ carries with it other commitments—which may seem to tie him down again,
        to be a restriction, but are experienced as a further release: new opportunities, calling forth fresh
        generosity. Loyalty to Christ means loyalty to the Church; loyalty to the Church means loyalty to the
        Pope... We thus come to three distinct phases in the subsequent narrative, each introduced by a brief
        chapter of transition. They could be labelled and developed in this way:\n
        In quest of the living Christ: He sallies forth from the castle of Loyola, on a spiritual adventure
        under the patronage of the Virgin Mary. Along the way, the Knight Errant is transformed into a true
        Pilgrim—a humble seeker after the fullness of truth. During his stay in the town of Manresa the Spirit
        leads him, through many trials and lessons, to a further profound experience of God as the one Reality
        embracing all reality. His journey to Jerusalem and the homeland of Christ is a practical application of
        his new insight, by a complete abandonment to divine providence. He gets the feel of the power of God
        at work in the destitute and the defenseless, and thus learns the secret of effectiveness in the cause of
        the Kingdom. (Chs. 2 to 4)\n
        At the service of God’s people: He is not allowed to stay in the Holy Land; without comment, he
        turns his back on a cherished plan and makes a fresh start: he will study in order to equip himself for a
        more universal apostolate in the Church, whilst already helping others to the best of his ability. He
        moves through several great universities and learns much more than theology: he comes to understand
        the various hazards that attend the evangelical enterprise, and to appreciate better than ever that zeal for
        the truth must be courageous, and not fearful: otherwise it does not lead to freedom but to an
        imprisoning of oneself and of others. (Chs. 5 to 8)\n
        Available to the Pope for mission: Another beginning, no longer of an individual but of a group, the
        Friends in the Lord whom Ignatius has gathered at the University of Paris and among whom he now
        assumes a definite leadership role. They bid farewell to their past and set their course eastwards for
        Jerusalem. But there is no way to get there and they see that their destiny is in Rome, to be at the
        disposal of the Pope for any task he might entrust to them. As they approach the city, Ignatius has
        another deep experience of God in Christ, of the Father placing him with his Son. This is a peak point
        for the Pilgrim. There is still a long and painful way to go; but that is no longer just his story: it is the
        history of the Society of Jesus. (Chs. 9 and 10)\n
        So the memoirs come rapidly to a close, with only a glimpse of Ignatius as Founder, writing the
        Constitutions; but also bequeathing to his followers a testament: his testimony to the spiritual journey
        that led him into the heart of his charism—finding God in all things, which is the ultimate in loyalty
        and in liberation. And here he makes the solemn affirmation that is quoted on the very first page of this
        volume, with regard to his attitude and intention in recounting his life. (Ch. 11)\n
        This last chapter spans as many years as the previous ten put together: the narrative begins with the
        wounding of Ignatius at Pamplona on May 20th, 1521; he came to Rome with his companions in
        November, 1537; and his concluding words were spoken on October 22, 1555, just months before his
        death.\n
        The whole account, though so compressed and involved, is replete with details that are both interesting
        and significant. But two events stand out as particularly important for an appreciation of the Ignatian
        charism: the “sublime enlightenment” on the banks of the Cardoner, in Manresa, and the experience of
        being “placed with Christ” at La Storta near Rome. Quite rightly, both have been regarded from the
        beginning as very relevant for the proper understanding of the Spiritual Exercises and of the Society of
        Jesus.\n
        They cannot be adequately commented on in a brief introduction, but neither can one pass them over
        in silence. The first seems to be a culmination of the conversion experience, a mystical realization of
        God as he really is—the Absolute, embracing in himself all reality, so that all creation is seen in a new
        light and acquires a new meaning which is its true meaning, and a new coherence and relevance.\n
        This is wisdom indeed and rightly called by the classical name of enlightenment. But there is still
        the process by which the awareness in depth must penetrate his whole being, so that everything in him,
        as in Christ, is response to God, and he can find God in other things.\n
        One may well believe that this further advance was made at La Storta, where he attains to a Christ-
        likeness wherein not only his fundamental attitude but his entire self, with all its activity, is imbued
        with the Spirit and directed to the Father.\n
        Ignatius was extremely reluctant to go into details about what happened, and used to refer to the
        report of Diego Lainez, to whom he had spoken at the time, and who was wont to state: “he said to me
        that he felt that God the Father had imprinted in his heart these words: I will be favorable to you in
        Rome... Then another time, he said he felt he saw Christ with the cross on his back, and the Eternal
        Father by his side, saying to him: I want you to take this man as your servant. And so Jesus took him,
        saying: I want you to serve us.”\n
        It is surely significant that the above key-words: Jesus—servant—Rome, reflect the successive
        themes of the whole narrative: Christ—service—Pope. They also highlight the basic dimensions of the
        Ignatian charism as set down in the foundational document of the Society of Jesus: “to serve the Lord
        alone, and his Bride the Church, under the Roman Pontiff.”\n
        As has been remarked, the original text of the Memoirs was not in circulation till the present
        century, when it was edited and published by the Historical Institute of the Society of Jesus.\n
        It is interesting to note that the first translation into a modern language was in English. In fact, two
        translations appeared precisely in 1900, on either side of the Atlantic, both by Jesuits: one American, J.
        F. X. O’Connor; the other British, E. M. Rix. But they worked on what was itself a loose translation.
        Today many versions are available, each having its advantages and limitations. Whatever merit the text
        presented here may have is due in large measure to its having been elaborated in Rome, at the Jesuit
        headquarters, with a privileged access to sources and authorities. Subsequently, friendly comments
        from many quarters were taken into account, and this is now the fourth edition.\n
        There is always room for improvement and for further effort because, as was pointed out at the
        beginning, the original is itself so rough. That seems to be the reason why it was never published till
        the present century, and why today there are so many editions in circulation. The fundamental problem
        is what should be the criterion for a good rendering of a bad composition, whose very meaning is
        sometimes obscure. Da Câmara himself says that on occasion he has sacrificed clarity for the sake of
        faithfulness to the exact words of Ignatius. Presumably the translator should emulate such fidelity even
        at the risk of damaging his own reputation as a writer. But is it fair to inflict on the reader a painful
        poverty of vocabulary and grammar, when it is possible to achieve a smoother flow of language
        without any loss to the sense of what is said?\n
        The principle that has been followed here is to keep to a middle course, leaning towards accuracy
        rather than elegance, but within the limits of correct and intelligible expression. Idiosyncrasies of style
        have generally been preserved. It is hoped that the impact of the final result will retain something of the
        force and the flavor of the original.\n

        [1] Myself and other Fathers had heard from our Father Ignatius that he had asked God to grant him three boons before he died.
        The first, that the Institute of the Society be confirmed by the Apostolic See. The second, likewise for the Spiritual Exercises.
        The third, that he might write the Constitutions.\n
        [2] As I was mindful of this, and saw that he had obtained them all, I was afraid lest he be called
        away from us to a better life. Since I knew also that the holy Fathers, founders of monastic institutes,
        had a tradition of leaving to their posterity, by way of a testament, such advice as they trusted would be
        helpful towards their perfection in virtue, I awaited an opportunity when I might conveniently request
        the same from Father Ignatius. It came in 1551 when we were together and Father Ignatius said: “Now
        I was higher than heaven”—having experienced, I conjecture, some ecstasy of mind or rapture, as he
        was frequently wont. Full of respect I ask: “What was it, Father?” He changed the conversation.
        Judging this to be an appropriate occasion, I request and beg the Father to tell us how God guided him
        from the beginning of his conversion, so that his account might be for us a sort of testament and
        paternal instruction. I say: “For now that you have obtained those three things, Father, which you
        desired to see before your demise, we are afraid you may be called to heaven.”\n
        [3] The Father cited his engagements as an excuse: he could give neither attention nor time to it.
        However, he said: “Celebrate three Masses about this matter, Polanco, Ponce, and yourself, and tell me
        what you think after prayer.” “We shall think exactly what we think now.” He added very gently: “Do
        as I say.” We did celebrate, and gave him the same reply; he promised to do it. The following year,
        when I again came back from Sicily to be sent to Spain, I asked the Father if he had done anything.
        “Nothing,” he replied. On my return from Spain in 1554 I again ask. He had not got down to it.
        Thereupon, moved by I know not what impulse, I said with firm determination: “It is almost four years,
        Father, since I asked you, not in my name only but that of other Fathers, to explain to us how the Lord
        guided you from the beginning of your conversion. We are convinced that this would be of the greatest
        utility to us and the Society. But as I see you are not amenable, I dare assure you: if you do what we so
        much desire we shall use such a boon most diligently; if you do not, we shall not for that be
        disheartened, but as confident in the Lord as if you had written everything.”\n
        [4] The Father made no reply, but called Father Luis Gonzalez (that same day, I think) and began to
        relate to him the things that Father Gonzalez with his excellent memory later wrote down. These are the
        Acta Patris Ignatii that are in circulation. Father Luis was an elector in the first General Congregation,
        and was there elected Assistant to the Superior General Father Lainez. He was later tutor and mentor to
        King Sebastian of Portugal—a Father outstanding in doctrine and virtue.\n
        Father Gonzalez wrote partly in Spanish, partly in Italian, as scribes were available. Father Anibal
        du Coudret, a learned and devout Father, made a Latin translation. Both author and translator are still
        alive.\n

        <string name="tp_para_preface">
        In the year ’53, one Friday morning, the fourth of August, eve of Our Lady of Snows, while the Father was
        in the garden by the house or apartment known as the Duke’s, I began to give him an account of some particulars concerning my soul.
        Among other things I spoke to him of vainglory. As a remedy the Father told me to refer everything of mine frequently to God,
        striving to offer him all the good I found in myself, acknowledging it as his and giving him thanks for it.
        He spoke to me about this in a manner that greatly consoled me, so that I could not restrain my tears.
        Thus the Father told me how much he had been bothered by this vice for two years, so much so that when he embarked from Barcelona for Jerusalem,
        he did not dare tell anyone that he was going to Jerusalem; and so in other similar instances.
        And he went on to say how much peace of soul he then felt in this regard.\n
        An hour or two after this we went in to dine. While Master Polanco and I were eating with him, the
        Father said that Master Nadal and others of the Society had often asked something of him, and he had
        never made up his mind about it. But that after having spoken with me, when he had retired to his
        room, he had such a devout inclination to do it, and (speaking in a manner that showed that God had
        greatly enlightened him as to his duty to do so) that he was fully decided on this: to narrate all that
        occurred in his soul until now. He had also decided that I should be the one to whom he would reveal
        these things.\n
        The Father was very ill at that time and never would promise himself a single day of life. Rather, if
        someone says, “I will do this a fortnight from now or a week from now,” the Father always says with
        an air of amazement, “What, do you think you will live that long?” And yet this time he said that he
        expected to live three or four months to finish this business. The next day I spoke to him, asking when
        he wished us to begin; he replied that I should remind him of it each day (I do not remember how many
        days) until he was ready for it. But putting it off because of business, he later arranged that I remind
        him each Sunday. So in September (I do not remember how many days) the Father called me and
        began to tell me about his whole life and his youthful escapades, clearly and distinctly and with all the
        details. Later in the same month he called me three or four times and carried his story down to his early
        days in Manresa, as one may see by the writing in a different hand.\n
        The Father’s narrative style is the same that he uses in everything. He speaks with such clarity that
        he seems to make all that has passed present to one. Therefore, it was not necessary to ask him
        anything because the Father remembered to tell everything that helped to make one understand. Then,
        without saying anything to the Father, I went immediately to write it down, first in notes by my own
        hand and later at greater length, as it is written. I have striven not to put down any words except those
        that I heard from the Father. If at all in some things I fear I have failed, it is that in order not to depart
        from the Father’s words, I have not been able to explain adequately the point of some of them.\n
        Thus I wrote this, as said above, until September ’53; but from then until Father Nadal came on
        October 18, ’54, the Father was always excusing himself because of some illness or various affairs on
        hand, saying to me, “When that affair is over, remind me of it”; and when it was over and I reminded
        him of it, he would say, “We are now with this other; when it is over, remind me of it.”\n
        When Father Nadal came, he was very pleased that it was begun but bade me urge the Father, telling
        me many times that the Father could do nothing of greater benefit for the Society than this, and that this
        was truly to found the Society. He himself spoke to me to remind him of it when the business of
        endowing the College was finished, but after it was done, when the affair of Prester John was finished
        and the mail had gone.\n
        We got going with the story on the ninth of March, but Pope Julius III began to be in a serious
        condition at that time and died on the twenty-third, so the Father postponed the matter until there was a
        pope. There was one, but he also fell ill immediately and died (that was Marcellus). The Father delayed
        until the election of Pope Paul IV; and afterwards, because of the great heat and his many engagements,
        postponed it continually until the twenty-first of September when my being sent to Spain began to be
        discussed. For this reason I strongly pressed the Father to fulfill his promise to me. So now he arranged
        to do it in the morning of the twenty-second, in the Red Tower. Accordingly, when I had finished
        saying Mass, I presented myself to him to ask if it was time.\n
        He replied that I should wait for him in the Red Tower, so that when he arrived, I would be there. I
        took it that I would have to wait for him a long time in that place; and as I tarried at a porch speaking
        with a brother who had asked me something, the Father came along and reproved me because, failing
        in obedience, I had not waited for him in the Red Tower. He did not want to do anything that whole
        day.\n
        Later we were again very insistent with him. So he returned to the Red Tower and dictated pacing
        about, as he had always done before. In order to observe his face I kept coming a little closer to him,
        but the Father said to me, “Keep the rule.” When, forgetting his remark, I came up to him, failing thus
        two or three times, the Father repeated the same remark and walked off. At length he returned to the
        same Tower and finished dictating to me what is written down. But as I was for some time already on
        the point of undertaking my journey (for the eve of my departure was the last day on which the Father
        spoke to me about this matter), I could not have everything fully written out in Rome. And not having a
        Spanish scribe in Genoa, I dictated in Italian whatever I had brought in summary from Rome. I finished
        the writing in December, 1555, in Genoa.\n

        him, one had taken such a hold on his heart that he was absorbed in thinking about it for two and three
        and four hours without realizing it:"\u2074"he imagined what he would do in the service of a certain lady; the
        means he would take so he could go to the place where she lived; the quips—the words he would
        address to her; the feats of arms he would perform in her service."\u2075"He became so infatuated with this
        that he did not consider how impossible of attainment it would be, because the lady was not of ordinary
        nobility: not a countess nor a duchess; but her station was higher than any of these.\n
        [7]"\u00B9"Nevertheless Our Lord assisted him, causing other thoughts, that arose from the things he read, to
        follow these."\u00B2"For in reading the life of Our Lord and of the saints, he stopped to think, reasoning
        within himself, “What if I should do this which St. Francis did, and this which St. Dominic did?”"\u00B3"Thus
        he pondered over many things that he found good, always proposing to himself what was difficult and
        burdensome and as he so proposed, it seemed easy for him to accomplish it."\u2074"But he did not more than
        argue within himself, saying, “St. Dominic did this, so I have to do it; St. Francis did this, so I have to
        do it.”\n
        "\u2075"These thoughts also lasted a good while; then, other things coming in between, the worldly ones
        mentioned above returned, and he also stayed long with them."\u2076"This succession of such diverse
        thoughts lasted for quite some time, and he always dwelt at length upon the thought that turned up,
        "\u2077"either of the worldly exploits he wished to perform or of these others of God that came to his
        imagination, until he tired of it and put it aside and turned to other matters.\n
        [8]"\u00B9"Yet there was this difference. When he was thinking of those things of the world, he took much
        delight in them, but afterwards, when he was tired and put them aside, he found himself dry and
        dissatisfied."\u00B2"But when he thought of going to Jerusalem barefoot, and of eating nothing but plain
        vegetables and of practicing all the other rigors that he saw in the saints, "\u00B3"not only was he consoled

        "\u2074"He did not notice this, however; nor did he stop to ponder the distinction until the time when his
        eyes were opened a little, and he began to marvel at the difference and to reflect upon it,"\u2075"realizing
        from experience that some thoughts left him sad and others joyful. Little by little he came to recognize
        the difference between the spirits that were stirring, one from the devil, the other from God. *\n
        [9]"\u00B9"From this lesson he derived not a little light, and he began to think more earnestly about his past
        life and about the great need he had to do penance for it."\u00B2"At this point the desire to imitate the saints
        came to him though he gave no thought to particulars, only promising with God’s grace to do as they
        had done."\u00B3"But the one thing he wanted to do was to go to Jerusalem as soon as he recovered, as
        mentioned above, with as much of disciplines and fasts as a generous spirit, ablaze with God, would
        want to perform.\n
        [10]"\u00B9"And so he began to forget the previous thoughts, with these holy desires he had, and they were
        confirmed by a spiritual experience, in this manner."\u00B2"One night while he was awake, he saw clearly an
        image of Our Lady with the holy Child Jesus. From this sight he received for a considerable time very
        great consolation, and he was left with such loathing for his whole past life, "\u00B3"and especially for the
        things of the flesh, that it seemed to him that his spirit was rid of all the figures that had been painted
        on it."\u2074"Thus from that hour until August ‘ 53 when this was written, he never gave the slightest consent
        to the things of the flesh. For this reason it may be considered the work of God, although he did not
        dare to claim it nor said more than to affirm the above."\u2075"But his brother as well as all the rest of the
        household came to know from his exterior the change that had been wrought inwardly in his soul.\n
        [11]"\u00B9"With no worry at all, he persevered in his reading and his good resolutions; and all his time of
        conversation with members of the household he spent on the things of God; thus he benefited their
        souls."\u00B2"As he very much liked those books, the idea came to him to note down briefly some of the more
        essential things from the life of Christ and the saints; "\u00B3"so he set himself very diligently to write a book
        (because he was now beginning to be up and about the house a bit) with red ink for the words of Christ,

        [1] The probable year of Ignatius’s birth is 1491. He would be aged twenty-six when he entered the service of the Duke of Nájera,
        Antonio Manrique de Lara, who was Viceroy of Navarre under the Emperor Charles V.
        There are several references in the text to the struggle between the Emperor and the French King Francis I.
        But the wounding of Ignatius in the defense of Pamplona, capital of Navarre, with which his story begins,
        happened on May 20, 1521, when he must have been about thirty years old. He seems to have recounted some early escapades,
        whose omission from the text (on whose authority, it is not known) has disturbed the chronology.\n
        [2] The castle of Loyola, in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa, had been deprived of its upper storeys
        and warlike battlements, which were replaced by a more peaceful and artistic construction in brick; on
        the top floor was the room occupied by Ignatius, later made into a chapel. The whole edifice is now
        surrounded by a basilica and other buildings.\n
        [5] The books given to Ignatius seem to have belonged to his sister-in-law Magdalena, who was
        something of a mother to him. The Life of Christ was by the Carthusian Ludolf of Saxony—in four
        volumes; the other book was the Flos Sanctorum or Golden Legend by the Dominican Bishop Jacobo
        de Varazze.\n
        [6] It has been impossible to determine the identity of the lady of the daydreams. The best guess points
        to Princess Catalina, the charming younger sister of the Emperor Charles V, who was then in her early
        teens and later married King John III of Portugal, a generous patron of the Jesuits.\n
        [8] Here comes the first of thirteen marginal notes by da Câmara, which are here given in Roman type
        in the footnotes. He speaks of diversity of spirits, and so does Ignatius; but it is rather a question of the
        difference between two spirits. It is generally understood that Ignatius says that the spirits were moving
        him, but the original uses the reflexive construction “se agitaban,” which means simply that they were
        in motion, or were stirring.\n
        [12] The eldest brother, Juan Pérez, had died. The head of the family was now Martín García, referred
        to here, who was married to Magdalena de Araoz; he was much older than Iñigo, later known as
        Ignatius, who was the youngest. The brother in the next chapter was probably the priest, Pero López.\n

        [13] "\u00B9"And so, as he mounted a mule, another brother wished to go with him as far as Oñate.
        On the road he persuaded him to join in a vigil at Our Lady of Aránzazu."\u00B2"That night he prayed there that he might gain fresh strength for his journey.
        He left his brother in Oñate at the house of a sister he was going to visit, and himself went on to Navarrete. *\n
        "\u00B3"Remembering that a few ducats were owed him at the duke’s household, he thought it would be
        well to collect them; for this he wrote out a bill for the treasurer."\u2074"The treasurer said he had no money;
        and the duke hearing this said there might be a lack for everything but no lacking for Loyola—to whom
        he wanted to give a good position, if he would accept it, because of the reputation he had earned in the
        past. "\u2075"He collected the money and arranged that it be distributed among certain persons to whom he felt
        indebted, with a part for a statue of Our Lady that was in ill repair, so it could be repaired and
        handsomely adorned. "\u2076"Then, dismissing the two servants who had come with him, he set out alone on
        his mule from Navarrete for Montserrat.\n
        [14] "\u00B9"On the way something happened to him which it would be well to record, so one may understand
        how Our Lord dealt with this soul, which was still blind, though greatly desirous of serving him as far
        as his knowledge went. "\u00B2"Thus, he decided to do great penances, no longer with an eye to satisfying for
        his sins so much as to please and gratify God. "\u00B3" So when it occurred to him to do some penance that the
        saints practiced, he determined to do the same and even more. **\n
        "\u2074"From these thoughts he derived all his consolation, not looking to any interior thing, nor knowing
        what humility was or charity or patience; or the discretion that regulates and measures these virtues.
        5 His whole intention was to do such great external works because the saints had done so for the glory
        of God, without considering any more particular prospect.\n
        [15] "\u00B9"Well, as he was going on his way, a Moor came up to him riding on a mule. They went along
        chatting together and got to talking about Our Lady; and the Moor said it seemed to him that the Virgin
        had indeed conceived without a man, "\u00B2"but he could not believe in her giving birth whilst remaining a
        virgin. In support of this he cited the natural arguments that suggested themselves to him. "\u00B3"The pilgrim,
        in spite of the many reasons he gave him, could not demolish this opinion. "\u2074"The Moor then went ahead
        so quickly that he lost sight of him, and he was left pondering over what had transpired with the Moor.\n
        "\u2075"At this, various emotions came over him and caused discontent in his soul, as it seemed that he had
        not done his duty. "\u2076" They also aroused his indignation against the Moor, for it seemed that he had done

        wrong in allowing the Moor to say such things about Our Lady, and that he ought to sally forth in defense of her honor. "\u2077"He felt inclined to
        go in search of the Moor and stab him with his dagger for what he had said. After a long engagement in this struggle of inclinations,
        he remained uncertain at the end, not knowing what he ought to do. "\u2078"The Moor, who had moved ahead,
        had told him that he was going to a place a little further on the same road, very near the highway, though the highway did not pass through the place.\n
        [16] "\u00B9"So, being tired of examining what would be best to do and not arriving at a definite conclusion,
        he decided as follows: to let the mule go with reins slack as far as the place where the ways parted.
        "\u00B2"And if the mule took the village road, he would seek out the Moor and stab him; if the mule did not go
        toward the village but took the highway, he would let him be. "\u00B3"And doing as he had thought, Our Lord
        deigned that although the village was little more than thirty or forty paces away, and the road to it was
        very broad and very good, the mule took the highway and left the village road.\n
        "\u2074"Coming to a large town before Montserrat, he decided to buy there the attire he had resolved to
        wear—and use when going to Jerusalem. "\u2075"He bought cloth from which sacks are usually made, loosely
        woven and very prickly. Then he ordered a long garment to be made from it, reaching to his feet. He
        bought a pilgrim’s staff and a small gourd and put everything in front by the mule’s saddle. *\n
        [17] "\u00B9"He went on his way to Montserrat, thinking as he always did of the exploits he would perform
        for the love of God. "\u00B2"And as his mind was all full of tales like Amadis de Gaul and such books, the
        ideas that came to him were along those lines. "\u00B3"Thus he decided to keep a vigil of arms one whole
        night, without sitting or lying down, but standing a while and kneeling a while, before the altar of Our
        Lady of Montserrat, where he resolved to lay aside his garments and to don the armor of Christ.
        "\u2074"So leaving this place, he set off, thinking as usual of his resolutions.\n
        On arrival at Montserrat, after praying and fixing an appointment with the confessor, he made a
        general confession in writing; "\u2075"it lasted three days. He arranged with the confessor to have his mule
        taken in charge, and his sword and dagger placed in the church at the altar of Our Lady. "\u2076"This was the
        first man to whom he revealed his decision, because until then he had not revealed it to any confessor.\n
        [18] "\u00B9" On the eve of Our Lady in March, at night, in the year 1522 , he went as secretly as he could to a
        beggar—and stripping off all his garments he gave them to a beggar; he dressed himself in his chosen
        attire and went to kneel before the altar of Our Lady. "\u00B2"At times in this way, at other times standing,
        with his pilgrim’s staff in his hand, he spent the whole night.\n
        "\u00B3"He left at daybreak so as not to be recognized, and did not take the road that led straight to
        Barcelona, where he would come across many who would recognize and honor him, "\u2074"but turned off to
        a town called Manresa. Here he planned to stay in a hospice a few days—and also to note some things
        in his book; this he carried around very carefully, and he was greatly consoled by it.\n

        he had given the clothing "\u2077"—in compassion, for he realized they were harassing him, thinking he had stolen them.\n
        "\u2078"Yet as much as he avoided favorable notice, he could not remain long in Manresa before people
        had a big story to tell—their ideas coming from what happened at Montserrat; and soon the tale grew
        into saying more than the truth: that he had given up a large income, etc.\n

        [13] Aránzazu was only a little hermitage at the time, but a popular shrine. There is now a big basilica and a large Franciscan establishment.\n
        [16] Ignatius may not have been as naive as he makes himself out to be, in the incident of the mule.
        It could well have happened that in relinquishing the reins he also let go his mental confusion and emotional turmoil,
        and came to rest at a deeper level of being whence he could take a more objective view of reality and even unconsciously guide the mule to the right track.
        There is here the basic pattern of discernment.\n
        [17] Amadis de Gaul is a mythical Prince of Wales, whose romantic story first appeared in 1508 and in eighty years achieved an incredible thirtieth edition;
        its success led inevitably to a sequel on the son of Amadis, Esplandian, said to have been invested as a knight with a vigil of arms, before an image of the Virgin Mary.\n
        The confessor of the pilgrims was the saintly Frenchman Jean Chanon; he seems to have
        introduced Ignatius to the so-called Devotio Moderna, one of whose masterpieces is the Imitation of
        Christ, which he soon came to know and love.\n
        [18] The Black Virgin of Montserrat is one of the most famous Madonnas in the world, and the
        Benedictine monastery around it is a dearly loved place of pilgrimage, for nearly a thousand years.\n
        The long break in the process of dictation by Ignatius, noted by da Câmara, seems to have taken
        place at the end of this chapter, where the first days in Manresa are recorded.\n

        <string name="tp_chap_three_para">
        [19] "\u00B9"He begged alms in Manresa every day. He did not eat meat nor drink wine, even though they were offered to him.
        He did not fast on Sundays, and if they gave him a little wine, he drank it. Because he had been very fastidious in taking care of his hair,
        as was the fashion at that time (and his was handsome), "\u00B2"he decided to let it go its way according to nature without combing or
        cutting it or covering it with anything by night or day. "\u00B3"For the same reason he let the nails grow on toes and fingers
        because he had been fastidious in this too.\n
        "\u2074"While in this hospice it often happened that in broad daylight he saw something in the air near
        him. It gave him great consolation because it was very beautiful—remarkably so. "\u2075"He could not discern
        very well the kind of thing it was, but in a way it seemed to him to have the form of a serpent with
        many things that shone like eyes, though they were not. "\u2076"He found great pleasure and consolation in
        seeing this thing, and the oftener he saw it the more his consolation grew. When it disappeared, he was
        displeased.\n
        [20] "\u00B9"Until this time he had remained always in nearly the same interior state of very steady joy,
        without having any knowledge of interior things of the spirit. "\u00B2"The days while that vision lasted or
        somewhat before it began (for it lasted many days), a forceful thought came to trouble him by pointing
        out the hardships of his life, like a voice within his soul. “How will you be able to endure this life for
        the seventy years you have to live?” "\u00B3"Sensing that it was from the enemy, he answered interiorly with
        great vehemence, “Wretch! Can you promise me an hour of life?” So he overcame the temptation and
        remained at peace. "\u2074"This was the first temptation that came to him after what is mentioned above. "\u2075"It
        happened when he was entering a church where he heard High Mass each day and Vespers and
        Compline, all sung, finding in this great comfort. Usually he read the Passion at Mass, always retaining
        his serenity.\n
        [21] "\u00B9"But soon after the temptation noted above, he began to have great changes in his soul. Sometimes
        he felt so out of sorts that he found no relish in saying prayers nor in hearing Mass nor in any other
        devotion he might practice. "\u00B2"At other times quite the opposite of this came over him so suddenly that
        he seemed to have thrown off sadness and desolation just as one snatches a cape from another’s
        shoulders. "\u00B3"Now he started getting perturbed by the changes that he had never experienced before, and
        he said to himself, “What new life is this that we are now beginning?”\n
        "\u2074"At this time he still conversed occasionally with spiritual persons who had regard for him and
        wanted to talk to him, "\u2075"because even though he had no knowledge of spiritual matters, yet in his speech
        he revealed great fervor and eagerness to go forward in God’s service. "\u2076"At that time there was at
        Manresa a woman of great age, with a long record also as a servant of God, and known as such in many
        parts of Spain, so much so that the Catholic King had summoned her once to communicate something.
        "\u2077"One day this woman, speaking to the new soldier of Christ, said to him, “O! May my Lord Jesus Christ deign to appear to you some day.”
        "\u2078"But he was startled at this, taking the matter quite literally,
        “How would Jesus Christ appear to me?” "\u2079"He persevered steadily in his usual confession and
        communion each Sunday.\n
        [22] "\u00B9"But here he began to have much trouble from scruples, "\u00B2"for even though the general confession
        he had made at Montserrat had been quite carefully done and all in writing as has been said, "\u00B3"still at
        times it seemed to him that he had not confessed certain things. This caused him much distress, because
        although he confessed that, he was not satisfied. "\u2074"Thus he began to look for some spiritual men who
        could cure him of these scruples, but nothing helped him. "\u2075"Finally, a doctor of the cathedral, a very
        spiritual man who preached there, told him one day in confession to write down everything he could
        remember. "\u2076"He did so, but after confession the scruples still returned, becoming increasingly minute so
        that he was in great distress.\n
        "\u2077"Although he was practically convinced that those scruples did him much harm and that it would
        be good to be rid of them, he could not break himself off. "\u2078"Sometimes he thought it would cure him if
        his confessor ordered him in the name of Jesus Christ not to confess anything of the past; he wanted his
        confessor to order him thus, but he did not dare say this to his confessor.\n
        [23] "\u00B9"But without his saying so, his confessor ordered him not to confess anything of the past, unless it
        was something quite clear. "\u00B2"But since he found all those things to be very clear, this order was of no
        use to him, and so he continued with the difficulty. "\u00B3"At this time he was staying in a small room that
        the Dominicans had given him in their monastery. He persevered in his seven hours of prayer on his
        knees, getting up regularly at midnight, and in all the other exercises mentioned earlier. "\u2074"But in none of
        them did he find any cure for his scruples; and it was many months that they were tormenting him.\n
        "\u2075"Once when he was very distressed by them, he began to pray, and roused to fervor he shouted out
        loud to God, saying, "\u2076"”Help me, Lord, for I find no remedy in men nor in any creature; yet if I thought
        I could find it, no labor would be too hard for me. "\u2077"Yourself, Lord, show me where I may find it; even
        though I should have to chase after a puppy that it may give me the remedy, I will do it.”\n
        [24] "\u00B9"While he had these thoughts, the temptation often came over him with great force to throw
        himself through a large hole in his room, next to the place where he was praying. "\u00B2"But realizing that it
        was a sin to kill oneself, he shouted again, “Lord, I will do nothing that offends you,” repeating these
        words many times, as well as the previous ones. "\u00B3"Then there came to his mind the story of a saint who,
        in order to obtain from God something that he wanted very much, went without eating many days until
        he got it. "\u2074"Thinking about this for a good while, he at last decided to do it, telling himself that he would
        not eat nor drink until God succored him, or until he saw that death was quite close— "\u2075"for should it
        happen that he found himself at the extreme limit, so that he would soon die if he did not eat, then he
        thought to ask for bread and to eat (as if indeed at that limit he would be able to ask or to eat).\n
        [25] "\u00B9"This happened one Sunday after he had received communion; he persevered the whole week
        without putting anything into his mouth, not ceasing to do his usual exercises, even going to divine
        office and saying his prayers on his knees, even at midnight, etc. "\u00B2"But when the next Sunday came and he had to go to confession,
        since he used to tell his confessor in great detail what he had done, he also
        told him how he had eaten nothing during that week. "\u00B3"His confessor ordered him to break that fast; and
        though he still felt strong, he nevertheless obeyed his confessor, and that day and the next he felt free
        from scruples. "\u2074"But on the third day, which was Tuesday, while at prayer he began to remember his
        sins; "\u2075"and so, as in a process of threading, he went on thinking of sin after sin from his past and felt he
        was obliged to confess them again. "\u2076"But after these thoughts, disgust for the life he led came over him,
        with impulses to give it up.\n
        In this way the Lord deigned that he awake as from sleep. "\u2077"As he now had some experience of the
        diversity of spirits from the lessons God had given him, he began to examine the means by which that
        spirit had come. He thus decided with great lucidity not to confess anything from the past any more;
        "\u2078"and so from that day forward he remained free of those scruples and held it for certain that Our Lord
        had mercifully deigned to deliver him.\n
        [26] "\u00B9"Besides his seven hours of prayer he busied himself helping in spiritual matters certain souls who
        came there looking for him. All the rest of the day he spent thinking about the things of God that he had
        meditated upon or read that day. "\u00B2"But when he went to bed, great enlightenment, great spiritual
        consolations, often came to him; so that they made him lose much of the time he had allotted to sleep,
        which was not much. "\u00B3"Examining this several times, he thought to himself that he had ample time
        assigned for converse with God, and all the rest of the day as well; "\u2074"and he began to doubt, therefore,
        whether that enlightenment came from a good spirit. He concluded that it would be better to ignore it
        and to sleep for the allotted time. And so he did.\n
        [27] "\u00B9"He continued to abstain from eating meat and was so determined about it that he would not think
        of changing it for any reason; but one day, when he got up in the morning, edible meat appeared before
        him as if he saw it with his ordinary eyes, though no desire for it had preceded. "\u00B2"At the same time he
        also had a strong inclination of his will to eat it from then on. Although he remembered his previous
        intention, he had no doubt about this, but rather a conviction that he ought to eat meat. "\u00B3"Later, on
        reporting this to his confessor, the confessor told him to consider whether perhaps this was a
        temptation; but examining it carefully, never could he doubt about it.\n
        "\u2074"God treated him at this time just as a schoolmaster treats a child whom he is teaching. Whether
        this was because of his lack of education and of brains, or because he had no one to teach him, or
        because of the strong desire God himself had given him to serve him, "\u2075"he believed without doubt and
        has always believed that God treated him in this way. Indeed if he were to doubt this, he would think he
        offended his Divine Majesty. Something of this can be seen from the five following points.\n
        [28] "\u00B9"First: He had great devotion to the Most Holy Trinity, and so each day he prayed to the three
        Persons separately. "\u00B2"But as he also prayed to the Most Holy Trinity, the thought came to him: why did
        he have to say four prayers to the Trinity? But this thought gave him little or no difficulty, being hardly
        important. "\u00B3"One day while saying the Office of Our Lady on the steps of the same monastery, his
        understanding began to be elevated as though he saw the Most Holy Trinity in the form of three musical keys.
        This brought on so many tears and so much sobbing that he could not control himself.
        "\u2074"That morning, on going in a procession that set out from there, he could not hold back his tears until
        dinner time; nor after eating could he stop talking about the Most Holy Trinity, "\u2075"using many
        comparisons in great variety and with much joy and consolation. As a result, the effect has remained
        with him throughout his life of feeling great devotion while praying to the Most Holy Trinity.\n
        [29] "\u00B9"Second: Once, the manner in which God had created the world was presented to his
        understanding with great spiritual joy. He seemed to see something white, from which some rays were
        coming, and God made light from these. "\u00B2"But he did not know how to explain these things, nor did he
        remember too well the spiritual enlightenment that God was imprinting on his soul at the time. "\u00B3"Third:
        At Manresa too, where he stayed almost a year, after he began to be consoled by God, and saw the fruit
        which he bore in dealing with souls, he gave up those extremes he had formerly practiced, and he now
        cut his nails and his hair. "\u2074"One day in this town, while he was hearing Mass in the church of the
        monastery mentioned above, at the elevation of the Body of the Lord, he saw with interior eyes
        something like white rays coming from above. "\u2075"Although he cannot explain this very well after so long
        a time, nevertheless what he saw clearly with his understanding was how Jesus Christ our Lord was
        there in that Most Holy Sacrament.\n
        "\u2076"Fourth: Often and for a long time, while at prayer, he saw with interior eyes the humanity of
        Christ. The form that appeared to him was like a white body, neither very large nor very small, but he
        did not see any distinction of members. "\u2077"He saw it at Manresa many times. If he should say twenty or
        forty, he would not dare judge it a lie. He has seen this another time in Jerusalem and yet another while
        traveling near Padua. "\u2078"He has also seen Our Lady in a similar form, without distinguishing parts.
        "\u2079"These things he saw strengthened him then and always gave him such strength in his faith that he has
        often thought to himself: if there were no Scriptures to teach us these matters of faith, he would be
        resolved to die for them, solely because of what he has seen.\n
        [30] "\u00B9"Fifth: Once he was going out of devotion to a church situated a little more than a mile from
        Manresa; I believe it is called St. Paul’s and the road goes by the river. As he went along occupied with
        his devotions, he sat down for a little while with his face toward the river, which ran down below.
        "\u00B2"While he was seated there, the eyes of his understanding began to be opened; not that he saw any
        vision, but he understood and learned many things, both spiritual matters and matters of faith and of
        scholarship and this with so great an enlightenment that everything seemed new to him. *\n
        "\u00B3"The details that he understood then, though there were many, cannot be stated, but only that he
        experienced a great clarity in his understanding. "\u2074"This was such that in the whole course of his life,
        after completing sixty -two years, even if he gathered up all the various helps he may have had from
        God and all the various things he has known, even adding them all together, he does not think he had
        got as much as at that one time.\n
        [31] "\u00B9"After this had lasted for a good while, he went to kneel before a nearby cross to give thanks to\n


    </string>

        <string name="tp_chap_three_expla">*This left his understanding so very enlightened that he felt as if he were another man with another mind.</string>

        <string name="tp_para_chapter_three_cont">
        God. "\u00B2"There, the vision that had appeared to him many times but which he had never understood, that is,
        the thing mentioned above which seemed very beautiful to him, with many eyes, now appeared to him. "\u00B3"But while before the cross,
        he saw clearly that the object did not have its usual beautiful color, and he knew very clearly with a strong agreement of
        his will that it was the devil. "\u2074"Later it would often appear to him for a long time; and by way of contempt he dispelled
        it with a staff he used to carry in his hand.\n
        [32] "\u00B9"Once while he was ill at Manresa, a very severe fever brought him to the point of death, and he
        fully believed that his soul was about to leave him. "\u00B2"At this a thought came to him telling him that he
        was a just man, but this caused him so much trouble that he constantly rejected it and called his sins to
        mind. "\u00B3"He had more trouble with this thought than with the fever itself, but no matter how much
        trouble he took to overcome the thought, he could not overcome it. "\u2074"Then somewhat relieved of the
        fever, he was no longer at the point of expiring, and he began to shout loudly to some ladies who had
        come there to visit him, "\u2075"that for the love of God, when they next saw him at the point of death, they
        should shout at him with loud voices, addressing him as sinner: let him remember the offenses he had
        committed against God.\n
        [33] "\u00B9"Another time, while going by sea from Valencia to Italy in a violent storm, the rudder of the ship
        was broken, and the situation reached such a pass that in his judgment and that of many others who
        sailed on the ship, they could not by natural means escape death. "\u00B2"At this time, examining himself
        carefully and preparing to die, he could not feel afraid for his sins or of being condemned, "\u00B3"but he did
        feel embarrassment and sorrow, as he believed he had not used well the gifts and graces which God our
        Lord had granted him.\n
        "\u2074"Another time, in the year ’50, he was very bad with a very severe illness which, in his opinion as
        well as of many others, would be the last. "\u2075"On this occasion, thinking about death, he felt such joy and
        such spiritual consolation at having to die that he dissolved entirely into tears. "\u2076"This became so habitual
        that he often stopped thinking about death so as not to feel so much of that consolation.\n
        [34] "\u00B9"When winter came he was down with a very severe illness, and for treatment the town put him in
        a house of the father of one Ferrera, who was later in the service of Balthasar de Faria. "\u00B2"There he was
        cared for with great attention; and many prominent ladies, because of the deep regard they now had for
        him, came to watch over him by night. "\u00B3"Though he recovered from this illness, he was still very weak
        and with frequent stomach pains. "\u2074"For these reasons, therefore, and because the winter was very cold,
        they made him dress up and wear shoes and cover his head; so they made him use two brown jackets of
        very coarse cloth and a cap of the same, something like a beret. "\u2075"At this time there was a long period
        during which he was eager to converse on spiritual matters and to find persons who could deal with
        them. Meantime, the time was approaching when he planned to set out for Jerusalem.\n
        [35] "\u00B9"So at the beginning of the year ’23 he set out for Barcelona to take ship. Although there were
        some offers of company, he wanted to go quite alone, for his whole idea was to have God alone as
        refuge. "\u00B2"One day when some were urging strongly, because he did not know either the Italian or the
        Latin languages, that he have a certain companion, telling him how much this would help him and
        praising the person highly, "\u00B3"he said that he would not go even in the company of the son or the brother
        of the Duke of Cardona, because he wanted to practice three virtues—charity, faith, and hope. "\u2074"If he
        took a companion, he would expect help from him when he was hungry; if he fell down, the man would
        help him get up; and so also he would trust him and feel attachment to him on this account; but he
        wanted to place that trust, attachment, and expectation in God alone.\n
        "\u2075"What he said in this way, he felt just so in his heart. With these thoughts, he not only had the
        desire to set out alone but also to go without any provisions. "\u2076"When he began to arrange for his
        passage, he got round the master of the ship to carry him free, as he had no money, but on condition
        that he brought to the ship some biscuit for his sustenance; otherwise, for nothing in the world would
        they accept him.\n
        [36] "\u00B9"When he went to obtain the biscuit, great scruples came over him: “Is this the hope and faith you
        had in God who would not fail you?” etc. "\u00B2"This was so powerful as to trouble him greatly; "\u00B3"at last, not
        knowing what to do because he saw probable reasons on both sides, he decided to place himself in the
        hands of his confessor. "\u2074"So he told him how much he wanted to seek perfection and whatever would be
        more to the glory of God, and the reasons that caused him to doubt whether he ought to take any
        provisions. "\u2075"The confessor decided that he should beg what was necessary and take it with him. As he
        begged from a lady, she asked where he was planning to travel. "\u2076"He hesitated a bit whether he would
        tell her, but at last he ventured to say no more than that he was going to Italy and to Rome. "\u2077"And as if
        in amazement, she said, “You want to go to Rome? Well, I don’t know how those who go there come
        back.” (She meant to say that in Rome one profited little in spiritual things.) "\u2078"Now the reason why he
        did not dare say that he was going to Jerusalem was fear of vainglory. This fear haunted him so, he
        never dared say to what country or to what family he belonged. "\u2079"At last, having the biscuit, he went on
        board. But at the shore he found he had five or six blancas left from what he was given begging from
        door to door (for he used to live that way); he left them on a bench that he came across there by the
        shore.\n
        [37] "\u00B9"So he embarked, having been in Barcelona a little more than twenty days. "\u00B2"While he was still in
        Barcelona before embarking, he sought out, as was his practice, all spiritual persons, even though they
        lived in hermitages far from the city, to converse with them. "\u00B3"But neither in Barcelona nor in Manresa
        during the whole time he was there did he find persons who could help him as much as he wished;
        "\u2074"only in Manresa that woman mentioned above, who told him she prayed God that Jesus Christ might
        appear to him: she alone seemed to him to enter more deeply into spiritual matters. "\u2075"Therefore, after
        leaving Barcelona, he completely lost this eagerness to seek out spiritual persons.\n

        <string name="tp_notes_to_chapter_three">[19] Manresa is a little town in the Spanish province of Catalonia, not exactly between Montserrat and Barcelona, but not far from either. It would seem that the long break in the dictation, mentioned by da Câmara, occurred at the end of the previous chapter, though some place it in the middle of this one. [20] One can notice three phases in Ignatius’s spiritual experience in Manresa: first he had peace, then trials, finally special graces and enlightenment. There is much in this chapter that illustrates what is said in the Spiritual Exercises, particularly about the discernment of spirits. [34] Among the ladies attending on Ignatius was Inés Pascual, who became a close friend of his; she later gave him accommodation with her son during his stay in Barcelona, and the first of his many extant letters is addressed to her. [36] Here and in subsequent chapters, coins are mentioned, belonging to different currencies; they have been left as in the original unless there was a recognizable English equivalent. The “etc.” that occurs here and elsewhere does not mean that something is omitted, but that Ignatius broke off the discourse.</string>

        [38] "\u00B9"They had such a strong wind at the stern that they reached Gaeta from Barcelona in five days and nights, though
        they were all thoroughly frightened because of very rough weather. "\u00B2"Throughout all that region there was fear of the plague;
        but as soon as he disembarked he began the journey to Rome. "\u00B3"Of those who came on the ship, a mother and her daughter whom
        she had in boy’s clothing, and another youth, accompanied him. They joined him because they also were begging.\n
        "\u2074"Having reached a lodge, they came upon a great blaze with many soldiers at it, who gave them to
        eat, and a good deal of wine, coaxing them as if they wanted to warm them up. "\u2075"Later they separated
        them, the mother and daughter being placed in a room above and the pilgrim and the youth in a stable.
        "\u2076"But at midnight, he heard loud cries there on top; getting up to see what it was, he found the mother
        and her daughter in the courtyard below, wailing and complaining that there was an attempt to violate
        them. "\u2077"At this such a strong feeling came over him that he began to shout, “Must one put up with this?”
        and similar protests. "\u2078"He uttered these words with such force that all those in the house were startled,
        and no one did him any harm. "\u2079"The youth had already fled, and though it was still night, all three got
        going.\n
        [39] "\u00B9"When they arrived at a nearby city, they found it closed. Unable to enter, the three of them spent
        the night in a leaky church there. "\u00B2"In the morning they were refused entry into the city, and they found
        no alms outside, even though they went to a castle which could be seen nearby. There the pilgrim felt
        weak because of the hardships on the sea as well as all else, etc.; "\u00B3"unable to travel further, he remained
        there. The mother and her daughter went on to Rome.\n
        "\u2074"That day many people came out of the city; learning that the Lady of the place was coming there,
        he approached her saying that he was ill only from weakness, "\u2075"and asked her to let him enter the city to
        seek some cure; which she readily granted. "\u2076"And starting to beg through the city he obtained a fair
        amount. After two days of recovery there, he set out on his journey again and arrived in Rome on Palm
        Sunday.\n
        [40] "\u00B9"Here all who spoke to him, on discovering that he did not carry any money for Jerusalem, began
        to dissuade him from making that trip, asserting with many arguments that it was impossible to find
        passage without money. "\u00B2"But he had great assurance in his soul and he could not doubt but that he
        would in fact find a way to go to Jerusalem. "\u00B3"After receiving the blessing of Pope Adrian VI, he set out
        for Venice eight or nine days after Easter. "\u2074"He did have six or seven ducats which had been given him
        for the passage from Venice to Jerusalem; he had accepted them, being somewhat overcome by the
        fears suggested to him that he would not otherwise make the passage. "\u2075"But two days after leaving
        Rome, he began to realize that this was a lack of trust on his part, and it greatly bothered him that he
        had accepted the ducats, so he wondered if it would be good to be rid of them. "\u2076"He finally decided to
        give them generously to those who approached him, who were beggars usually. "\u2077"He so managed that when
        he eventually arrived in Venice, he had no more than a small amount which he required that night.\n
        [41] "\u00B9"While on the journey to Venice, he slept in doorways because of the guards against the plague. It
        happened once that when he got up in the morning he ran into a man who, with one look, fled in horror,
        presumably because he saw him so very pale. "\u00B2"Traveling in this way, he came to Chioggia, and with
        some companions who had joined him, he learned that they would not be allowed to enter Venice. "\u00B3"His
        companions decided to go to Padua to obtain a certificate of health there, so he set out with them. But
        he could not keep up for they went very fast, leaving him at nightfall in a large field.\n
        "\u2074"While he was there, Christ appeared to him in the manner in which he usually appeared to him, as
        we have mentioned above, and this brought him much comfort. "\u2075"Consoled in this way, the next
        morning, without forging a certificate as (I believe) his companions had done, he came to the gates of
        Padua and entered without the guards asking anything of him. "\u2076"The same thing happened when he left;
        this greatly astonished his companions who had just got a certificate to go to Venice, about which he
        did not bother.\n
        [42] "\u00B9"When they arrived at Venice, the guards came to the boat to examine them all, one by one, as
        many as were in it, but him alone they let be. "\u00B2"He maintained himself in Venice by begging, and he
        slept in St. Mark’s Square. But he would never go to the house of the Emperor’s ambassador, nor did
        he take any special care to seek the means for his passage. "\u00B3"He had a great assurance in his soul that
        God would provide a way for him to go to Jerusalem; this gave him such confidence that no arguments
        or fears suggested to him could make him doubt.\n
        "\u2074"One day he ran into a rich Spaniard who asked him what he was doing and where he wanted to go.
        Learning his purpose, the man took him home to dinner, and kept him for a few days till all was set for
        the departure. "\u2075"Ever since Manresa the pilgrim had the habit when he ate with anyone, never to speak
        at table except to answer briefly; but he listened to what was said and noted some things which he took
        as the occasion to speak about God, and when the meal was finished, he did so.\n
        [43] "\u00B9"This was the reason why the worthy gentleman and all his household were so attached to him and
        wanted him to stay and made an effort to keep him there. This same host brought him to the Doge of
        Venice so he could speak to him; that is, he obtained entrance and an audience for him. "\u00B2"When the
        Doge heard the pilgrim, he ordered that he be given passage on the ship of the government officials
        who were going to Cyprus.\n
        "\u00B3"Although many pilgrims had come that year for Jerusalem, most of them had returned home
        because of the recent event which had occurred, the capture of Rhodes. "\u2074"Even so there were thirteen on
        the pilgrim ship which sailed first, and eight or nine remained for the government officials’ ship. As
        this was about to leave, our pilgrim had a severe bout of fever "\u2075"but after troubling him a few days, it
        left him. The ship was sailing on the day he had taken a purge. "\u2076"The people of the house asked the
        doctor if he could embark for Jerusalem, and the doctor said that indeed he could embark, if he wanted
        to be buried there. "\u2077"But he did embark and sail that day; and he vomited in such a way that he felt much relieved and began to recover completely.\n
        "\u2078"He severely condemned some obscenities and indecencies that were openly practiced on the ship.
        [44] "\u00B9"The Spaniards who were there warned him not to do so, because the ship’s crew were planning to
        leave him on some island. "\u00B2"But Our Lord deigned that they arrive quickly at Cyprus. Leaving the ship
        there, they went overland to another port called Las Salinas, ten leagues away. They boarded the
        pilgrim ship, on which also he brought no more for his maintenance than his hope in God, as he had
        done on the other.\n
        "\u00B3"During all this time, Our Lord appeared to him often, giving him great consolation and
        determination; but what he seemed to see was something round and large, as though it were of gold;
        and this was what presented itself to him. Having left Cyprus they arrived at Jaffa.\n
        "\u2074"Moving on to Jerusalem on their little donkeys, as is usually done, two miles before they reached
        Jerusalem, a Spaniard—a noble, it would seem, named Diego Manes—suggested with great devotion to
        all the pilgrims, "\u2075"that since in a little while they would reach the place from which they could see the
        Holy City, it would be well for all to prepare their consciences and go in silence.\n
        [45] "\u00B9"This seemed good to them all, and each one began to be recollected. A little before coming to the
        place from where it could be seen, they dismounted, because they saw the friars with the cross,
        awaiting them. On seeing the city the pilgrim felt great consolation; "\u00B2"and as the others testified, this
        was common to them all, with a joy that did not seem natural. He always felt this same devotion on his
        visits to the holy places.\n
        "\u00B3"His firm intention was to remain in Jerusalem, continually visiting those holy places; and in
        addiction to this devotion, he also planned to help souls. For this purpose he had brought some letters
        of recommendation for the Guardian and gave them to him. He told him of his intention to remain there
        because of his devotion; "\u2074"but not the second part, about wanting to help souls, because he had not told
        this to anyone, whilst he had frequently made public the first. "\u2075"The Guardian answered that he did not
        see how he could stay because the house was in such need that it could not support the friars; for that
        reason, he had decided to send some with the pilgrims, to these parts. "\u2076"The pilgrim replied that he
        wanted nothing from the house, except only that when he came sometimes to confess, they would hear
        his confession. "\u2077"With that the Guardian told him that such an arrangement might work, but he would
        have to wait for the coming of the Provincial (I believe he was the head of the Order in that area), who
        was at Bethlehem.\n
        [46] "\u00B9"By this promise the pilgrim was reassured and began to write letters to Barcelona to spiritual
        persons. "\u00B2"Having already written one and while writing another on the eve of the departure of the
        pilgrims, he received a summons from the Provincial (for he had arrived) and the Guardian. "\u00B3"The
        Provincial spoke kindly to him, saying that he knew of his good intention to remain in those holy
        places, and he had given much thought to the matter; but because of the experience he had had with
        others, he judged that it was not expedient. "\u2074"For many had had that desire, but some had been captured
        and others killed, and the Order had later been obliged to ransom the captives. Therefore he should
        prepare to leave the next day with the pilgrims.\n
        "\u2075"He replied to this that he was very firm in his purpose and was resolved that on no account would
        he fail to carry it out. He frankly gave them to understand that even though the Provincial thought
        otherwise, if there was nothing binding him under sin, he would not abandon his intention out of any
        fear. "\u2076"To this the Provincial replied that they had authority from the Apostolic See to have anyone
        leave the place, or remain there, as they judged, and to excommunicate anyone who was unwilling to
        obey them; and that in this case they thought that he should not remain, etc.\n
        [47] "\u00B9"He wanted to show him the bulls giving them power to excommunicate, but he said he did not
        need to see them, as he believed their reverences; in as much as they had so decided with the authority
        they had, he would obey them. "\u00B2"When this was over, returning to where he had been before, he felt a
        strong desire to visit Mount Olivet again before leaving, since it was not Our Lord’s will that he remain
        in those holy places. "\u00B3"On Mount Olivet there is a stone from which Our Lord rose up to heaven, and his
        footprints are still seen there; this was what he wanted to see again.\n
        "\u2074"So without saying anything or taking a guide (for those who go without a Turk as guide run a great
        risk), he slipped away from the others and went alone to Mount Olivet. "\u2075"But the guards would not let
        him enter. He gave them a penknife that he carried, and after praying with great consolation, he felt the
        desire to go to Bethphage. "\u2076"While there he remembered that he had not noted on Mount Olivet on what
        side the right foot was, or on what side the left. Returning there, I think he gave his scissors to the
        guards so they would let him enter.\n
        [48] "\u00B9"When it was learned in the monastery that he had gone like that without a guide, the friars took
        steps to find him. So as he was coming down from Mount Olivet he ran into a “belted” Christian who
        served in the monastery. He had a large staff and with a great show of annoyance made as if to strike
        him. "\u00B2"When he came up to him he grabbed him tightly by the arm, and he readily let himself be led.
        The good man, however, never let him go. "\u00B3"As he went along this way, held thus by the “belted”
        Christian, he felt great consolation from Our Lord, so that it seemed to him that he saw Christ over him
        continually. "\u2074"This lasted all through in great abundance until he reached the monastery.\n

        [44] According to the punctuation that is adopted, Ignatius is either saying that his experience of Christ took place after he left Cyprus from Jaffa,
        or (as in our translation) stressing that he did not actually see Christ; he is meticulous in his statements.\n
        Scholars have studied in depth, and discussed at length, the nature of Ignatius’s spiritual experiences, both mystical and ordinary,
        as recorded in his writings and other available sources; but it is difficult to come to any definite conclusions.
        He himself was not concerned about technicalities, and though he tries to be precise, his language is not always clear.\n
        [48] Syrian Christians, who served in the convent, were known as “belted” because of the way they dressed.\n

        [49] "\u00B9"The next day they set out, and after arriving at Cyprus, the pilgrims dispersed in different ships.
        In the port there were three or four ships bound for Venice. "\u00B2"One was Turkish, another was a very small vessel,
        and the third was a very rich and powerful ship belonging to a wealthy Venetian. "\u00B3"Some pilgrims asked the master
        of this ship kindly to take the pilgrim; but when he learned that he had no money, he did not want to, even though
        many made petition, praising him, etc. "\u2074"The master answered that if he was a saint, he should make his passage as
        St. James had done, or something like that. "\u2075"These same petitioners very easily succeeded with the master of the small vessel.\n
        "\u2076"They set out one day with a good wind in the morning; but in the afternoon a storm came upon
        them, and they got separated one from the other. The big one was wrecked near those same islands of
        Cyprus, and only the people escaped; in the same storm the Turkish ship was lost and all the people
        with it. "\u2077"The small vessel had great trouble, but in the end they reached land somewhere in Apulia.
        "\u2078"This was in the depth of winter, and it was very cold and snowing. The pilgrim had no clothing other
        than some breeches of coarse cloth—knee length and legs bare—with shoes and a doublet of black
        cloth, opened by many slashes at the shoulders, and a jacket that was short and quite thin.\n
        [50] "\u00B9"He arrived in Venice in mid-January of the year ‘ 24 , having been at sea from Cyprus the whole
        months of November and December and what was gone of January. "\u00B2"In Venice, one of the two who
        had welcomed him in their homes before he set out for Jerusalem, met him and gave him as alms
        fifteen or sixteen giulii and a piece of cloth, which he folded many times and put over his stomach
        because of the great cold.\n
        "\u00B3"After the pilgrim realized that it was God’s will that he do not stay in Jerusalem, he continually
        pondered within himself what he ought to do; and eventually he was rather inclined to study for some
        time so he would be able to help souls, and he decided to go to Barcelona. "\u2074"So he set out from Venice
        for Genoa. One day, whilst going through his devotions in the principal church of Ferrara, a beggar
        asked him for alms and he gave him a marchetto, which is a coin of five or six quatrini. After that
        another came, and he gave him another small coin that he had, somewhat larger; "\u2075"and to a third he gave
        a giulio, having nothing but giulii. The beggars, seeing that he was giving alms, kept coming and so all
        he had was finished. "\u2076"Finally, many beggars came together seeking alms. His response was to ask
        pardon, as he had nothing left.\n
        [51] "\u00B9"So he left Ferrara for Genoa. On the road he met some Spanish soldiers who treated him well that
        night; "\u00B2"but they were much surprised that he traveled that road, because one had to pass practically
        between the two armies, the French and the Imperial. They urged him to leave the highway and to take
        another safe road that they showed him. "\u00B3"But he did not take their advice. Instead, traveling straight on,
        he came upon a burned and destroyed village; and so till night he found no one to give him anything to
        eat.\n
        "\u2074"But at sunset he reached a walled place where the guards immediately seized him, thinking he was
        a spy. "\u2075"They put him in a cabin next to the gate and began to question him, as is usual when there is
        some suspicion, but he replied to all their questions that he knew nothing. "\u2076"They stripped him and
        searched him down to his shoes, and all over his body, to see if he was carrying any letters. "\u2077"Unable to
        learn anything by any means, they took hold of him that he might appear before the captain—he would
        make him talk. "\u2078"He asked them to take him clothed in his jacket, but they refused to give it to him and
        took him in the breeches and doublet mentioned above.\n
        [52] "\u00B9"On the way the pilgrim had some sort of impression of when Christ was led away, but this was
        not a vision like the others. "\u00B2"He was led through three main streets, and he went without any sadness,
        but rather with joy and satisfaction. "\u00B3"It was his custom to speak to any person, no matter who it might
        be, using “you”—piously holding that Christ and the apostles had spoken in this way, etc. "\u2074"As he was
        going thus through the streets, it crossed his fancy that it would be wise to give up that custom in this
        situation and address the captain as “Sir.” This because of some fear of the tortures they might inflict,
        etc. "\u2075"But recognizing that this was a temptation, “Since it is such,” he said, “I will not address him as
        Sir nor do him reverence nor take off my cap to him.”\n
        [53] "\u00B9"They reached the captain’s headquarters and left him in a lower room. A while later the captain
        spoke to him. "\u00B2"Without using any form of courtesy, he answered him in a few words, with a noticeable
        interval between one and the next. "\u00B3"The captain took him for a madman and said so to those who had
        brought him: “This man is not in his senses. Give him his things and throw him out.” "\u2074"Just on leaving
        the headquarters he met a Spaniard who lived there; he took him to his house and gave him something
        to break his fast and all the necessaries for that night.\n
        "\u2075"Setting out in the morning, he traveled until evening, when two soldiers in a tower saw him and
        came down to seize him. "\u2076"They took him to their captain, who was French; the captain asked him,
        among other things, from what country he came, and learning that he was from Guipuzcoa, he said to
        him, “I come from near there,” apparently from near Bayonne. Then he said, “Take him and give him
        supper and treat him well.” "\u2077"On this road from Ferrara to Genoa he had many other little experiences.\n
        At last he reached Genoa where a Vizcayan named Portundo, who had spoken with him on other
        occasions when he served in the court of the Catholic King, recognized him. "\u2078"This man got him
        passage on a ship going to Barcelona, in which he ran great danger of being captured by Andrea Doria,
        who gave chase, being then on the French side.\n

        [49] Rather characteristically, Ignatius has much to say of his journey to and from Palestine, and little
        of his experience in the Holy Land and at the sacred places. But two fellow pilgrims have left detailed
        accounts of the program that was followed: the Swiss Peter Fussli and Philip Hagan from Strasbourg.\n
        The sojourn lasted three weeks in September, 1523: 4 th, arrival in Jerusalem; 5th, around the city,
        Mount Sion, the Cenacle, the Holy Sepulchre; 6th, the Way of the Cross; 7th, Bethany, Mount Olivet;
        8th and 9th, Bethlehem; 10th, Josaphat, Cedron; 11th, Holy Sepulchre; 12th and 13th, rest; 14th,
        excursion to Jericho and the Jordan; the remaining days in Jerusalem, till departure on the 23 rd.\n
        [53] Ignatius was never directly in the service of the Catholic King Ferdinand, but of his chief revenue
        officer, Juan Velázquez de Cuéllar, at Arévalo, before he went to serve under the Duke of Nájera.\n

        <string name="tp_chap_six_para">
        [54] "\u00B9"When he arrived at Barcelona he made his wish to study known to Isabel Roser and to a Master Ardévol who taught grammar.
        "\u00B2"To both this seemed a very good idea; he offered to teach him for nothing, and she to give him what he needed to support himself.
        "\u00B3"In Manresa the pilgrim had known a friar (of the Order of St. Bernard, I think), a very spiritual man; he wanted to be with this
        person to learn and to be able to give himself more easily to the spirit, as also to be of help to souls.
        "\u2074"So he replied that he would accept the offer if he did not find in Manresa the facilities he was looking for.
        But when he went there, he found that the friar was dead.\n
        So, returning to Barcelona, he began to study with great diligence. "\u2075"But one thing was very much in
        his way: that is, when he began to memorize, as one must in the beginnings of grammar, there came to
        him new insights into spiritual matters and fresh relish, "\u2076"to such an extent that he could not memorize,
        nor could he drive them away no matter how much he resisted.\n
        [55] "\u00B9"So, thinking often about this, he said to himself, “Not even when I engage in prayer and am at
        Mass do such vivid insights come to me.” Thus, little by little, he came to realize that it was a
        temptation. "\u00B2"After praying he went to Our Lady of the Sea, near the master’s house, having asked that
        he kindly listen to him just a while in that church. "\u00B3"So when they were all seated, he told him exactly
        all that went on in his soul and what little progress he had made until then for that reason; but he
        promised this same master, saying, “ "\u2074"I promise you never to fail to listen to you these two years, so
        long as I can find bread and water in Barcelona with which I might support myself.” "\u2075"As he made this
        promise with great determination, he never again had those temptations. "\u2076"The stomach pain that
        afflicted him in Manresa, for which reason he wore shoes, was gone, and he had felt well in the
        stomach ever since he set out for Jerusalem. "\u2077"For this reason, while he was studying in Barcelona, he
        had the desire to resume his previous penances and so he began to make a hole in the soles of his shoes,
        which he kept widening little by little so that when the winter cold came, he was wearing only the
        uppers.\n
        [56] "\u00B9"After two years of studying during which, so they said, he had made great progress, his master
        informed him he could now study the liberal arts and should go to Alcalá. "\u00B2"Even so, he had himself
        examined by a doctor of theology who gave him the same advice. So he set out alone for Alcalá:
        though he already had some companions, I think.\n
        "\u00B3"When he arrived at Alcalá, he began to beg and to live on alms. "\u2074"After he had lived in this fashion
        for ten or twelve days, a cleric and others who were with him, seeing him beg alms one day, began to
        laugh at him and to utter some insults, as one usually does to those who, being healthy, go begging. "\u2075"At
        that moment the superintendent of the new hospice of Antezana passed by, and expressing regret at
        this, called him and took him to the hospice where he gave him a room and all he needed.\n
        [57] "\u00B9"He studied at Alcalá almost a year and a half. Since he had arrived in Barcelona in the year ’24
        during Lent, and had studied there for two years, it was in the year ’26 that he reached Alcalá. He
        studied the logic of Soto, the physics of Albert and the Master of the Sentences. "\u00B2"While at Alcalá, he
        was engaged in giving spiritual exercises and teaching Christian doctrine, and this bore fruit for the
        glory of God. "\u00B3"There were many persons who came to a deep understanding and relish of spiritual
        things; but others had various temptations— "\u2074"there was one such who wanted to take the discipline but
        could not do so, as though the hand were held, and other similar cases. These gave rise to talk among
        the people, especially because of the great crowd that gathered whenever he was explaining doctrine. *\n
        "\u2075"Soon after he arrived at Alcalá, he became acquainted with Don Diego de Guía who was staying
        with his brother, a printer in Alcalá and quite well off. "\u2076"So they helped him with alms to support the
        poor. The pilgrim’s three companions were lodged in his house. "\u2077"Once when they came to ask alms for
        some needs, Don Diego said he had no money, "\u2078"but he opened for him a chest in which he had various
        objects, and then gave him bed coverings of different colors and some candlesticks and suchlike things.
        Wrapping them all in a sheet, the pilgrim put them on his shoulders and went off to aid the poor.\n
        [58] "\u00B9"As mentioned above, there was much talk throughout that region about the things happening at
        Alcalá; some spoke one way, some another. "\u00B2"The thing reached the inquisitors at Toledo. When these
        came to Alcalá, the pilgrim was alerted by their host, who told him that they were calling them
        “ensayalados” and, I believe, “alumbrados,” ** and that they would butcher them. "\u00B3"So they began at
        once to investigate and examine their life and finally they returned to Toledo without summoning them,
        as they had come for that sole purpose.\n
        They left the trial to the vicar Figueroa, who is now with the Emperor. "\u2074"A few days later he
        summoned them and told them how an investigation and examination of their life had been made by
        the inquisitors and that no error had been found in their teaching nor in their life, and therefore they
        could go on doing the same as they did without any hindrance. "\u2075"But since they were not religious, it did
        not seem right for them to go about all in the same habit. It would be well, and he so ordered, that two
        of them, pointing to the pilgrim and Arteaga, dyed their clothes black; and that the other two, Calixto
        and Cáceres, dyed theirs brown; Little John, who was a French lad, could stay as he was.\n
        [59] "\u00B9"The pilgrim says they will do what they are ordered. “But,” he says, “I do not know what benefit
        these inquisitions bring; the other day a priest did not want to give the sacrament to someone because
        he went to communion every eight days; and they were objecting to me, too. "\u00B2"We would like to know if
        they have found any heresy in us.” “No,” says Figueroa, “for if they did they would burn you.” “They
        would burn you too,” says the pilgrim, “if they found heresy in you.” "\u00B3"They dye their clothing, as they
        are ordered, and fifteen or twenty days later, Figueroa orders the pilgrim not to go barefoot but to wear
        shoes; and so he does without fuss, as in all matters of this sort that he was ordered.\n

        "\u2074"Four months later Figueroa himself again began an investigation of them. Besides the usual reasons, I believe this was also something of a factor,
        that a married woman of rank had special regard for the pilgrim; and in order not to be noticed, she came to the hospice at dawn, wearing a veil,
        as is the custom in Alcalá de Henares. On entering, she removed her veil and went to the pilgrim’s room. "\u2075"But they did nothing to them this time either,
        nor did they say anything to them.*\n
        [60] "\u00B9"After another four months, he now being in a cabin outside the hospice, a policeman came to his
        door one day and called him, saying, “Just come with me.” "\u00B2"He put him in jail and said to him, “You
        may not leave here until you are ordered otherwise.” "\u00B3"This was in summertime, and as he was not
        confined, many people came to visit him.**\n
        He did the same things as when he was free, teaching and giving exercises. "\u2074"Never would he have
        an advocate or attorney, though many offered themselves. "\u2075"He especially remembers Doña Teresa de
        Cárdenas who sent someone to visit him and frequently offered to get him out; "\u2076"but he accepted
        nothing, always answering, “He for whose love I got in here will get me out, if he is served thereby.”\n
        [61] "\u00B9"He was in prison seventeen days without being examined or knowing the reason for it. At the end
        of that time Figueroa came to the jail and examined him about many things, even asking him if he
        enjoined observance of the sabbath; "\u00B2"and whether he knew two particular women, a mother and her
        daughter (and to this he said yes); "\u00B3"whether he had known of their departure before they had set out
        (and he said no, because of the oath he had accepted). "\u2074"The vicar then placed a hand on his shoulder,
        manifesting joy, and said, “This is the reason why you were brought here.”\n
        "\u2075"Among the many persons who followed the pilgrim there were a mother and her daughter, both
        widowed. The daughter was very young and very attractive. They had made great spiritual progress,
        especially the daughter. "\u2076"So much so that though they were noble women, they had gone to the
        Veronica of Jaén on foot; possibly begging, and unaccompanied. This caused considerable gossip in
        Alcalá, "\u2077"and Doctor Ciruelo, who had some responsibility for them, thought that the prisoner had
        persuaded them and for this reason had him arrested.\n
        "\u2078"Having taken in the vicar’s words, the prisoner said to him, “Would you like me to speak more at
        length about this affair?” He said, “Yes.” "\u2079"”Then you should know,” said the prisoner, “that these two
        women have often insisted with me that they wanted to go about the world serving the poor in one
        hospital and then in another. "\u00B9""\u2070"I have always dissuaded them from this plan, because the daughter is so
        young and so attractive, etc. And I have told them that when they wanted to visit the poor, they could
        do so in Alcalá, and could accompany the Blessed Sacrament.” "\u00B9""\u00B9"When this conversation was finished,
        Figueroa left with his notary, taking a complete written statement.\n

        who received him kindly and manifested the intention to send him to jail, for that is where he had to be till those women returned, to see if they
        confirmed what had been said. "\u00B3"Calixto remained in jail a few days, but when the pilgrim saw that this harmed his bodily health, because he was not
        yet entirely well, he had him released with the help of a doctor, a great friend of his.\n
        "\u2074"From the day the pilgrim entered jail until they let him out, forty-two days passed. At the end of
        that time, as the two pious women returned, the notary came to the jail to read the sentence: "\u2075"he should
        go free; and they should dress like the other students, and should not speak about matters of faith until
        they had studied for four more years, because they had no education. "\u2076"For in truth, the pilgrim was the
        one who had the most, and that was with little foundation. This was the first thing he used to say
        whenever they examined him.\n
        [63] "\u00B9"Because of this sentence he was somewhat doubtful what he should do, for seemingly they were
        closing the door for him to help souls, without giving him any reason except that he had not studied.
        "\u00B2"At last he decided to go to Fonseca, the archbishop of Toledo, and put the case in his hands. "\u00B3"He set
        out from Alcalá and found the Archbishop in Valladolid. Faithfully recounting the affair to him, he said
        that, even though he was not now in his jurisdiction nor obliged to abide by the sentence, still he would
        do whatever he commanded in this matter (he addressed him as “you” as was his custom with
        everyone). "\u2074"The Archbishop received him very well; adding he had friends and a college at Salamanca
        too, all of which he put at his disposal; and just as he was leaving, he had four escudos given to him.\n

        [54] Isabel Roser, great friend and benefactress of Ignatius over the years, came to Rome and actually made the solemn profession in the Society of Jesus in 1545.
        Later she returned to Barcelona and joined a convent.\n
        [56] It has been said, with rhetorical exaggeration, that the most significant feature of Ignatius’s
        history is that he readily went to school as an adult: he was always a learner, always open to reality. It
        has also often been noted that when he decides to dedicate himself to that apostolate, he sees the need
        of a solid intellectual formation. Less noted is that now he tries to gather companions, whereas earlier
        he had been adamant about going alone.\n
        [57] Diego de Eguía was related to Francis Xavier; he eventually entered the Society of Jesus and was
        confessor of Ignatius. The marginal notes in this chapter are not too clear; in the first we can only
        guess at some incident; the second seems to say: I will recall what Father Bustamante narrated; the
        third: Miona, who was his confessor, was among the visitors.\n
        [58] “Ensayalados” was just a nickname because Ignatius and his companions seemed to be wearing
        skirts. [The word sayal designates a coarse woolen cloth; ensayalados therefore refers to those who
        are garbed in sayal--ed.] “Alumbrados” was a more serious matter, for that referred to an anti-
        institutional movement of people who claimed to be illumined, or guided interiorly, without regard for
        established authority.\n
        [63] Throughout, Ignatius submits to legitimate superiors and obeys their orders; but he never
        surrenders his freedom of spirit; rather he progresses in it by deepening his original conversion
        experience of loyalty as liberation.\n

        [64] "\u00B9"On arrival in Salamanca, while he was praying in a church, he was recognized by a devoted friend of the group,
        for his four companions had been there some days already. She asked him his name and then took him to the lodgings of his companions.
        "\u00B2"When the sentence had been given in Alcalá that they should dress like students, the pilgrim said, “When you ordered us to dye our clothes, we did so;
        but now we cannot do this because we do not have the means to buy them.”
        "\u00B3"So the vicar himself provided them with clothing and caps and all the other student gear. Dressed in this fashion they had left Alcalá.\n
        "\u2074"At Salamanca he went to confession to a Dominican friar at St. Stephen’s. Ten or twelve days after
        his arrival the confessor said to him one day, “The fathers of the house would like to speak with you.”
        "\u2075"And he said, “In the name of God.” “Then,” said the confessor, “it would be well if you came here to
        dine on Sunday; but I warn you of one thing, that they will want to know many things from you.” "\u2076"So
        on Sunday he came with Calixto. After dinner, the subprior, in the absence of the prior, together with
        the confessor and, I think, with another friar, went with them to a chapel. "\u2077"With great cordiality the
        subprior began to say what good reports they had of their life and ways: that they went about preaching
        in apostolic fashion; and that they would be pleased to learn about these things in greater detail. "\u2078"So he
        began by asking what they had studied. The pilgrim replied, “Of all of us, I am the one who has studied
        the most,” and he gave a clear account of the little he had studied and with what little foundation.\n
        [65] "\u00B9"”Well, then, what do you preach?” “We do not preach,” said the pilgrim, “but we do speak
        familiarly with some people about the things of God; for example, after dinner with some people who
        invite us.” "\u00B2"”But,” said the friar, “what things of God do you speak about? That is just what we would
        like to know.” "\u00B3"”We speak,” said the pilgrim, “sometimes of one virtue, sometimes of another; and do
        so, praising it; sometimes of one vice, sometimes of another, condemning it.” "\u2074"”You are not learned
        men,” said the friar, “and you speak about virtues and vices; but no one can speak about these except in
        one of two ways: either through learning or through the Holy Spirit. If not through learning, then
        through the Holy Spirit.” *\n
        "\u2075"At this the pilgrim was somewhat on his guard, because that kind of argument did not seem good to
        him. After being silent a while, he said it was not necessary to speak further of these matters. "\u2076"The friar
        insisted, “Well, now that there are so many errors of Erasmus and of so many others who have
        deceived the world, you do not wish to explain what you say?”\n
        [66] "\u00B9"The pilgrim said, “Father, I will say no more than I have said, except before my superiors who
        can oblige me to do so.” "\u00B2"Before this the friar had asked why Calixto came dressed as he was: he wore
        a short tunic and a large hat on his head, with a staff in his hand and boots almost halfway up the leg;\n
    </string>

        <string name="tp_chap_seven_expla">*And this, of being from the Holy Spirit, is what we would like to find out.\n</string>

        <string name="tp_chap_seven_para_cont">
        and being very tall, he looked the more grotesque. "\u00B3"The pilgrim related how they had been imprisoned in Alcalá and
        had been ordered to dress like students and that his companion, because of the great heat, had given his gown to a poor cleric.
        "\u2074"At this the friar seemed to mutter to himself, indicating that he was not pleased, “Charity begins at home.”
        "\u2075"Well, getting back to the story: the subprior, unable to get any other word out of the pilgrim but that, said,
        “Then remain here, and we will indeed make you tell all.”
        "\u2076"So all the friars left in some haste.
        "\u2077"The pilgrim first asked if they wanted them to remain in that chapel, or where did they want them to remain.
        The subprior answered that they should remain in the chapel.
        "\u2078"The friars then closed all the doors and, as it appears, took the matter up with the judges.
        "\u2079"Still the two of them were in the monastery for three days, eating in the refectory with the friars,
        without anything being said to them in the name of the court.
        "\u00B9""\u2070"Their room was almost always full of friars who came to see them. The pilgrim always spoke on his usual topics;
        as a result there was already some division among them, many showing that they were sympathetic.\n
        [67] "\u00B9"At the end of three days a notary came and took them to jail. They were not put down below with
        the criminals but in an upper room where, because it was old and unused, there was much dirt. "\u00B2"They
        were both bound with the same chain, each one by his foot. "\u00B3"The chain was attached to a post in the
        middle of the house and would be ten or thirteen palms long. Each time that one wanted to do
        something, the other had to accompany him. "\u2074"All that night they kept awake. "\u2075"The next day, when their
        imprisonment was known in the city, people sent to the jail something on which they could sleep and
        all that was needed, in abundance. And always there was a crowd to visit them, and the pilgrim kept up
        his practice of speaking about God, etc.\n
        "\u2076"The bachelor Frias came to examine each of them separately, and the pilgrim gave him all his
        papers, which were the Exercises, to be examined. "\u2077"Asked if they had companions, they said they did,
        and where they were. Straightaway some went there, on the bachelor’s orders, and brought Cáceres and
        Arteaga to the jail; and they left Little John, who later became a friar. "\u2078"However they did not put them
        above with the other two but down where the common prisoners were. Neither here would he have an
        advocate or attorney.\n
        [68] "\u00B9"Some days later he was summoned before four judges: the three doctors, Sanctisidoro,
        Paravinhas, and Frias; and the fourth was the bachelor Frias. All of them had already seen the
        Exercises. "\u00B2"Now they asked him many things not only about the Exercises, but also about theology; for
        example, about the Trinity and the Eucharist, and how he understood these articles. First he made his
        introduction; "\u00B3"nevertheless, ordered by the judges, he spoke in such a manner that they had no reason to
        fault him. "\u2074"The bachelor Frias, who on these points had throughout been to the fore, also asked him
        about a canonical case. "\u2075"He was required to answer everything, but he always said first that he did not
        know what scholars said about those matters.\n
        "\u2076"Then they ordered him to explain the first commandment in the way he usually explained it. He
        started to do so and took so long and said so many things about the first commandment that they were
        not inclined to ask him more. "\u2077"Before this, when they were speaking about the Exercises, they insisted
        a good deal on one point only in them, which was at the beginning: when a thought is a venial sin and
        when it is mortal. "\u2078"The question was why he, without studies, was deciding that. He answered, “If this
        is true or not: decide that; and if it is not true, condemn it.” But in the end they left without condemning
        anything.\n
        [69] "\u00B9"Among the many who came to speak to him in jail, once Don Francisco de Mendoza, who now
        has the title of Cardinal of Burgos, came with the bachelor Frias. "\u00B2"In a friendly way he asked how he
        was getting on in prison and if it bothered him to be imprisoned. He replied, “I will answer what I
        answered today to a lady who, on seeing me in prison, spoke words of compassion. "\u00B3"I said to her, ‘By
        this you show that you do not wish to be imprisoned for the love of God. Does imprisonment seem to
        be such a great evil to you? Well, I will tell you that there are not so many fetters and chains in
        Salamanca that I do not want more for the love of God.’”\n
        "\u2074"At this time it happened that all the prisoners in the jail fled, but the two companions who were
        with them did not flee. "\u2075"In the morning when they were found there alone without anyone, with the
        doors open, all were deeply edified, and there was much talk in the city; so they gave them an entire
        mansion that was nearby, as a prison.\n
        [70] "\u00B9"After twenty-two days of imprisonment, they were summoned to hear the sentence, which was
        that no error was found in their life or teaching. "\u00B2"Therefore they could do what they had been doing,
        teaching doctrine and speaking about the things of God, so long as they never defined: this is a mortal
        sin or this is venial, until they had spent four years in further studies. "\u00B3"After the sentence was read, the
        judges displayed great affection, apparently wishing to make it acceptable. "\u2074"The pilgrim said he would
        do everything the sentence ordered, but he did not find it acceptable, because without condemning him
        for anything they shut his mouth so he might not help his neighbors in what he could. "\u2075"Although
        Doctor Frias urged and showed himself very well disposed, the pilgrim said no more—only that as long
        as he was in the jurisdiction of Salamanca he would do what had been ordered.\n
        "\u2076"Then they were released from jail, and he began to commend the matter to God and to think about
        what he ought to do. "\u2077"He found great difficulty in remaining in Salamanca, for it seemed to him that the
        door had been closed to helping souls, by this prohibition not to define mortal and venial sin.\n
        [71] "\u00B9"So he decided to go to Paris to study. "\u00B2"When the pilgrim was considering in Barcelona whether
        he should study and how much, his one concern had been whether, after he had studied, he would enter
        a religious institute or go about the world. "\u00B3"When thoughts of entering an institute came to him, then he
        also had the desire to enter a decadent and not quite reformed one (if he were to be a religious) so that
        he would suffer more in it; "\u2074"and thinking also that perhaps God would help them. And God gave him
        great confidence that he would endure easily all the insults and injuries they might inflict.\n
        "\u2075"Now, at the time of his imprisonment in Salamanca, he still felt the same desire that he had to help
        souls, and for that reason to study first and to gather some others with the same idea, and to keep those
        he had. "\u2076"Determined to go to Paris, he arranged with these that they would wait there while he went, to
        see if he could find some means by which they might study.\n
        [72] "\u00B9"Many important persons urged strongly that he should not go, but they could never dissuade him.
        Rather, fifteen or twenty days after leaving prison, he set out alone, taking some books on a little
        donkey. "\u00B2"When he arrived at Barcelona, all those who knew him advised him against the journey to
        France because of the fierce wars, recounting very specific instances, even telling him that they put
        Spaniards on spits; but he never had any kind of fear.\n

        <string name="tp_notes_to_chapter_seven">[64] The opening lines are usually translated as if Ignatius had been recognized by a devout lady as belonging to the group. What the Spanish says is that he was recognized by a lady devoted to the group.\n</string>

        <string name="tp_para_chapter_eight">
        [73] "\u00B9"So he set out for Paris, alone and on foot. He reached Paris in the month of February, or thereabouts; and as he tells me,
        this was in the year 1528 or 1527. "\u00B2"He lodged in a house with some Spaniards and went to study humanities at Montaigu.
        "\u00B3"The reason was that as they had made him advance with such haste in studies, he found himself very deficient in fundamentals.
        He studied with children following the order and method of Paris. *\n
        "\u2074"When he first came to Paris, a merchant gave him twenty-five escudos on a draft from Barcelona;
        and these he gave to one of the Spaniards in those lodgings to keep; but in a short time the latter spent
        them and had not the means to pay him. "\u2075"So already after Lent the pilgrim had nothing left of them,
        both because of his own expenses and because of the reason mentioned above. He was compelled to
        beg and even to leave the house where he was staying.\n
        [74] "\u00B9"He got admission into the hospice of St. James, beyond the Innocents. "\u00B2"He was greatly
        inconvenienced in study because the hospice was a good distance from the college of Montaigu, and in
        order to find the door open one had to return at the sound of the Angelus and to leave in daylight. Thus
        he could not attend his lectures properly. "\u00B3"Having to beg alms to support himself was another obstacle.\n
        It was almost five years now that he felt no stomach pains, so he began to subject himself to greater
        penances and fasts. "\u2074"After some time in this life of hospice and begging, seeing that he was making
        little progress in studies, he began to consider what he should do. Seeing that there were several who
        served some of the regents in the colleges and had time to study, he decided to seek a master.\n
        [75] "\u00B9"He found great consolation in the following reflection and resolution which he entertained,
        imagining that the master would be Christ, that one of the students he would call St. Peter and another
        St. John, and so with each one of the apostles: "\u00B2"”When the master orders me, I will think that Christ
        orders me; when another orders me, I will think that St. Peter orders me.” "\u00B3"He tried hard to find a
        master; for one thing, he spoke to the bachelor Castro, and also to a Carthusian friar who knew many
        teachers, and to others; but never could they find him a master.\n
        [76] "\u00B9"At last, as he found no solution, a Spanish friar told him one day that it would be better for him to
        go each year to Flanders and spend two months or even less, to secure the means to study the whole
        year. After commending this to God, it seemed good to him. "\u00B2"Following this advice, each year he
        brought back from Flanders enough to carry on in some way. Once he also went over to England and
        fetched more alms than he usually did in other years.\n
        [77] "\u00B9"The first time he returned from Flanders he got more involved than usual in spiritual contacts,
        and he gave exercises almost simultaneously to three persons, namely, Peralta, the bachelor Castro who\n

        was at the Sorbonne, and a Vizcayan named Amador, who was at St. Barbara. "\u00B2"These were quite transformed and so gave all they had to the poor,
        even their books, and began to beg alms through Paris. They went to lodge in the hospice of St. James, where the pilgrim had stayed
        before but which he had now left for the reasons mentioned above.\n
        "\u00B3"This caused great commotion in the university, for the first two were distinguished persons and
        well known. "\u2074"The Spaniards then began a campaign against the two masters; but not being able to
        convince them with much argument and persuasion, that they return to the university, one day many
        went armed and dragged them out of the hospice.\n
        [78] "\u00B9"When they were brought to the university, an agreement was arrived at, that after they had
        finished their studies, then they would carry out their plans. "\u00B2"The bachelor Castro later came to Spain
        and preached at Burgos for some time, and then became a Carthusian friar in Valencia. "\u00B3"Peralta set out
        on foot as a pilgrim to Jerusalem. In these circumstances he was captured in Italy by a captain, a
        relative of his, who took steps to bring him to the Pope, whom he got to order him to return to Spain.
        "\u2074"These things did not happen immediately but some years later.\n
        "\u2075"Great complaints arose in Paris, especially among the Spaniards, against the pilgrim. Our Master
        de Gouvea, saying that he had caused Amador, who was in his college, to go mad, decided and stated
        that the first time he came to St. Barbara he would subject him to a drubbing as a seducer of the
        students.\n
        [79] "\u00B9"The Spaniard with whom he had stayed at the beginning and who had spent his money without
        paying it back set out for Spain by way of Rouen; and awaiting passage at Rouen, he fell sick. "\u00B2"While
        he was thus ill, the pilgrim learned this from a letter of his and felt the desire to visit and help him. He
        also thought that in those circumstances he could win him over to leave the world and give himself
        completely to the service of God.\n
        "\u00B3"In order to achieve this he felt the desire to walk the twenty-eight leagues from Paris to Rouen
        barefoot, without eating or drinking. As he prayed over this, he felt very afraid. "\u2074"At last he went to St.
        Dominic’s and there he decided to go in the manner just mentioned, the great fear he had of tempting
        God having now passed.\n
        "\u2075"He got up early the next day, the morning that he was going to set out. As he began to dress, such a
        great fear came over him that he seemed almost unable to dress himself. "\u2076"In spite of that repugnance he
        left the house, and the city too, before it was quite daylight. "\u2077"Still the fear was with him constantly and
        persisted as far as Argenteuil, a walled town three leagues from Paris on the way to Rouen, where the
        garment of Our Lord is said to be. "\u2078"He passed the town with that spiritual distress, but as he came up to
        a rise, the thing began to go away. He felt great consolation and spiritual strength, with such joy that he
        began to shout through the fields and to speak to God, etc.\n
        "\u2079"He lodged that evening with a poor beggar in a hospice, having traveled fourteen leagues that day.
        The next day he sought shelter in a barn. The third day he reached Rouen: all this time without eating
        or drinking and barefoot, as he had determined. "\u00B9""\u2070"In Rouen he consoled the sick man and helped him
        board a ship to go to Spain. He also gave him letters directing him to the companions who were in
        Salamanca, namely, Calixto, Cáceres, and Arteaga.\n
        [80] "\u00B9"Not to have to speak further of these companions, their lot was this: "\u00B2"while the pilgrim was in
        Paris he wrote frequently to them, as they had agreed—about the scant facilities he had to bring them to
        Paris to study. "\u00B3"Still, he undertook to write to Dona Leonor de Mascarrenhas to assist Calixto with
        letters to the court of the King of Portugal, so he could obtain one of the scholarships which the King of
        Portugal gave in Paris. "\u2074"Dona Leonor gave Calixto the letters and a mule to ride and money for his
        expenses. "\u2075"Calixto went to the court of the King of Portugal, but in the end he did not come to Paris;
        rather, returning to Spain he went to the Imperial Indies with a certain spiritual woman. "\u2076"He returned to
        Spain later but went to the same Indies once more and this time returned to Spain a rich man, surprising
        all in Salamanca who had known him before.\n
        "\u2077"Cáceres returned to Segovia, which was his hometown, and there began to live in such a manner
        that he seemed to have forgotten his earlier resolution.\n
        "\u2078"Arteaga was made a comendador. Later, when the Society was already in Rome, he was offered a
        bishopric in the Indies. "\u2079"He wrote to the pilgrim that he give it to one of the Society, but the answer
        was in the negative, so he went to the Imperial Indies as a bishop and died there in strange
        circumstances: "\u00B9""\u2070"that is, when he happened to be ill, there were two water bottles to refresh him, one
        with water which the doctor had ordered for him, the other with Water of Soliman, a poison—the latter
        was given him by mistake and killed him.\n
        [81] "\u00B9"The pilgrim returned to Paris from Rouen and discovered that because of the affair of Castro and
        Peralta there was much talk regarding him and that the inquisitor had issued a summons for him. "\u00B2"But
        he would not wait further and went to the inquisitor, to whom he said that he understood he was
        looking for him, and that he was prepared for anything he might wish (the inquisitor was Our Master
        Ory, a Dominican friar), "\u00B3"but he would request that he expedite it, because he had in mind to enroll in
        the Arts course the coming St. Remy’s; he wanted to get this business over first so he would be better
        able to attend to his studies. "\u2074"The inquisitor did not summon him further, only telling him it was true
        that they had spoken of his doings, etc.\n
        [82] "\u00B9"A short time after this came St. Remy’s, that is, the first of October, and he enrolled in the Arts
        course under a teacher named Master Juan Peña— "\u00B2"enrolled with the idea of retaining those who had
        decided to serve the Lord, but not to go farther in search of others, so that he could study more
        earnestly.\n
        "\u00B3"As he began attending the lectures of the course, the same temptations began to come to him that
        had come when he studied grammar in Barcelona. Whenever he was at a lecture, he could not pay
        attention because of the many spiritual thoughts that came to him. "\u2074"Realizing that in this way he made
        little progress in study, he went to his master and promised he would never fail to follow the whole
        course, so long as he could find bread and water for his sustenance. "\u2075"After making this promise, all that
        devotion which came to him out of time left him, and he went on quietly with his studies.\n
        "\u2076"At this time he associated with Master Peter Faber and Master Francis Xavier, both of whom he
        later won for God’s service by means of the Exercises.\n
        "\u2077"At that stage in his course they did not harass him as before. "\u2078"With reference to this, Doctor Frago
        once told him how he marveled that he went about so peacefully, without anyone giving him trouble;
        and he replied, “The reason is because I do not speak to anyone of the things of God; but once the
        course is over, we’ll be back to business as usual.”\n
        [83] "\u00B9"While the two were speaking together, a friar came to ask Doctor Frago that he try to find him a
        house, because in the one where he had lodging, many people had died—of the plague, he thought; for
        the plague was then beginning in Paris. "\u00B2"Doctor Frago and the pilgrim wished to go to see the house.
        They took a woman well versed in these matters, and on entering in she confirmed that it was the
        plague. "\u00B3"The pilgrim also chose to enter. Coming upon a sick person, he comforted him and touched
        his sore with his hand.\n
        After he had comforted and encouraged him a while, he went off alone. "\u2074"His hand began to hurt so
        that it seemed he had caught the plague. This fancy was so strong that he could not overcome it until he
        thrust his hand forcefully into his mouth and moved it about inside, saying, “If you have the plague in
        the hand, you will also have it in the mouth.” "\u2075"When he had done this, he was rid of the fancy and of
        the pain in the hand.\n
        [84] "\u00B9"But when he returned to the college of St. Barbara where he then had lodging and was attending
        the course, those in the college who knew that he had entered the plague-ridden house, fled from him
        and would not let him enter. So he was forced to remain out for some days.\n
        "\u00B2"It is the custom in Paris for those who are studying Arts in the third year, in order to receive the
        baccalaureate, “to take a stone,” as they say. And because one has to spend an escudo for that, those
        who are very poor cannot do so. "\u00B3"The pilgrim began to wonder whether it would be good for him to
        take it. "\u2074"Finding himself in great doubt and undecided, he determined to put the matter in the hands of
        his master, who advised him to take it, and he did so. There were not lacking, however, some critics—
        at least one Spaniard who commented upon it.\n
        "\u2075"In Paris already by this time he was quite unwell in the stomach, so that every fifteen days he had a
        stomach ache which lasted over an hour and gave him a fever. Once the stomach ache lasted sixteen or
        seventeen hours. "\u2076"At this time he had already finished the Arts course and studied theology for some
        years, and gathered the companions. His trouble kept getting worse and worse, and he could not find a
        cure, though many were tried.\n
        [85] "\u00B9"The doctors said there was nothing left that might help him except his native air—just that.
        Moreover, the companions gave him the same advice and pressed him hard. "\u00B2"Already by this time they
        had all determined what they would do, sc., go to Venice and to Jerusalem, and spend their lives for the
        good of souls; "\u00B3"and if they were not given permission to remain in Jerusalem, then return to Rome and
        present themselves to the Vicar of Christ, so that he could make use of them wherever he thought it
        would be more for the glory of God and the good of souls. "\u2074"They also planned to wait a year in Venice
        for passage; "\u2075"but if there was no passage for the East that year, they would be free of their vow about
        Jerusalem and approach the Pope, etc.\n
        "\u2076"In the end, the pilgrim let himself be persuaded by the companions, and also because the Spaniards
        among them had some business which he could settle. "\u2077"It was agreed that when he felt well he should
        go and attend to their business, and then proceed to Venice where he would wait for the companions.\n
        [86] "\u00B9"This was the year ’35, and the companions were to set out, according to the agreement, in the
        year ’37 on the day of the Conversion of St. Paul; though in fact, because of the outbreak of war, they
        eventually left in November of the year ’36.\n
        "\u00B2"As the pilgrim was about to set out, he learned that he had been accused before the inquisitor, with
        a case brought against him. "\u00B3"Knowing this but seeing that they did not summon him, he went to the
        inquisitor and told him what he had heard and that he was about to set out for Spain and that he had
        companions: would he please pass sentence. "\u2074"The inquisitor said it was true there was an accusation,
        but that he did not find anything of importance in it. "\u2075"He only wanted to see his manuscript of the
        Exercises. When he saw it he praised it very much and asked the pilgrim to let him have the copy,
        which he did; "\u2076"nevertheless, he again insisted that the case be carried through to the sentence. As the
        inquisitor excused himself, he brought a public notary and witnesses to his house, and obtained a
        testimonial on this whole affair.\n

        [73] Montaigu was in several ways among the strictest of the fifty and more colleges of the University of Paris.
        Classes began at 5 a.m. Erasmus was there for some time, and then John Calvin. Ignatius later moved to St. Barbara which
        was at the meeting point of the old scholasticism and the new humanism.\n
        [79] In the original text, the portion in Spanish ends with the first paragraph. Up to here the actual
        words of Ignatius are recorded, according to da Câmara—who had to dictate the rest in such Italian as
        he could muster, when he stopped in Genoa on his way from Rome to Spain.\n
        To our modern mentality it is incredible that da Câmara, after protesting his scrupulous concern
        for exactitude, should make do with a poor translation, when presumably he could have written down
        the text himself.\n
        [82] Peter Faber, a Savoyard of humble origin, was the first stable companion of Ignatius and the first
        priest of the Society of Jesus. Francis Xavier was a young noble from Navarre and his family was on
        the French side in the struggle in which Ignatius was wounded at Pamplona.\n
        [85] Here we find the gist of the special features in the vows made at Montmartre on August 15, 1534,
        by Ignatius and his first permanent companions: Xavier, Laínez, Faber, Salmerón, Bobadilla,
        Rodrigues. The ceremony marked the birth of the Company, later officially constituted as the Society of
        Jesus.\n
        [86] Ignatius’s unrelenting concern to clear himself of any suspicion of heterodoxy must be understood
        in the context of the situation in which he lived. But more in general, he did regard good reputation as
        a valuable asset in the apostolate.\n

        [87] "\u00B9"With that done, he mounted the pony the companions had bought him and set out alone homewards. Along the way he felt much better.
        "\u00B2"When he arrived in the Province, he left the highway and took the mountain road, which was more secluded. Having moved along a bit,
        he saw two armed men who were approaching him (that road is somewhat notorious for assassins).
        "\u00B3"A little after they had passed him, they turned about and came toward him in great haste, and he was a little afraid.
        "\u2074"All the same he spoke to them, and learned that they were servants of his brother, who had sent them to meet him;
        "\u2075"because, as it seems he had news of his coming from Bayonne in France, where the pilgrim was recognized. So they went ahead, and he went the same way.\n
        "\u2076"Just before he got to the place, he came upon the above-mentioned men, who were approaching
        him. They were very insistent about taking him to his brother’s house, but they could not constrain him.
        "\u2077"So he went to the hospice and later at a convenient hour went to seek alms in the locality.\n
        [88] "\u00B9"In this hospice he began to speak with many who came to visit him, of the things of God, by
        whose grace much fruit was derived. "\u00B2"As soon as he arrived, he decided to teach Christian doctrine
        every day to children, but his brother strongly objected to this, saying no one would come. "\u00B3"He replied
        that one would be enough. But after he began to do it, many came continually to hear him; and even his
        brother.\n
        "\u2074"Besides Christian doctrine, he also preached on Sundays and feasts, with profit and help to the
        souls who came many miles to hear him. "\u2075"He also made an attempt to eliminate some abuses, and with
        God’s help some were set right. For example, he persuaded the one administering justice to have
        gambling banned under sanction. "\u2076"There was also another abuse there: namely, the girls in that region
        always go about with head uncovered and do not cover it until they are married. "\u2077"But there are many
        who have become concubines of priests and other men, and are faithful to them as though they were
        their wives. "\u2078"This is so common that the concubines are not at all ashamed to say that they have
        covered their heads for so-and-so, and are acknowledged as such.\n
        [89] "\u00B9"Much evil results from this custom. The pilgrim persuaded the governor to make a law that all
        those who covered the head for anyone, and were not the wives, should be legally punished. And so
        this abuse began to be corrected. "\u00B2"He got an order to be given that the poor should be provided for
        officially and regularly; "\u00B3"and that bells should be rung three times at the Angelus, that is, morning,
        noon, and evening, so that the people might pray, as in Rome.\n
        "\u2074"But though he had felt well at the beginning, he later fell seriously ill. "\u2075"Once he had recovered, he
        decided to set out to attend to the affairs his companions had entrusted to them, and to set out without
        money. At this his brother was very upset, and ashamed that he should go on foot. "\u2076"By evening the
        pilgrim was willing to settle for this: to go on horseback with his brother and his relatives to the border
        of the Province.\n
        [90] "\u00B9"But when he left the Province he got to his feet without taking anything and went towards
        Pamplona, and thence to Almazán, Father Laínez’s home; and then to Sigüenza and Toledo and from
        Toledo to Valencia. "\u00B2"In all these native places of his companions he would not take anything, although
        they offered him much with great insistence.\n
        "\u00B3"In Valencia he spoke with Castro who was a Carthusian monk. He wanted to sail to Genoa but
        good friends in Valencia begged him not to do so, because they said Barbarossa was on the sea with
        many ships, etc. "\u2074"Although they did say many things, enough to frighten him, nevertheless nothing
        made him hesitate.\n
        [91] "\u00B9"Boarding a large ship, he passed through the storm mentioned above, when it was said that he
        was on the point of death three times.\n
        "\u00B2"When he arrived at Genoa he took the road to Bologna, on which he suffered much, especially
        once when he lost his way and began to walk by a river, which was down below whilst the way was up
        above, and became ever more narrow the farther he went along it. "\u00B3"And it got so narrow that he could
        no longer go forward nor turn back. "\u2074"So he began to crawl along; and so he covered a great distance in
        great fear, because each time he moved he thought he would fall into the river. "\u2075"This was the greatest
        physical stress and strain that he ever experienced, but finally he got through.\n
        "\u2076"Making his way into Bologna and having to cross over a wooden footbridge, he fell off the bridge.
        Then, as he got up covered with mud and water, he made many bystanders laugh. "\u2077"Entering Bologna he
        began to beg alms, but not one small coin did he get though he sought everywhere. "\u2078"He was ill for
        some time in Bologna, but afterwards he went on to Venice, always in the same fashion.\n

        [87] The Province was Guipuzcoa, in which is the town of Azpeitia, where Loyola is situated.
        There is a pious tradition that Ignatius was solemnly received on arrival by the clergy.
        This seems based on a mistaken reading of the text: preti (priests) instead of predetti (above-mentioned).\n
        [89] There is a problem of punctuation: whether Ignatius was willing to settle by evening, or his brother was ashamed that he should go in the evening.
        We take the first alternative, as more likely.\n
        [91] A marked contrast here is noticeable between the courage and endurance stressed
        in the first chapter and the great fear that is admitted here. It is not that Ignatius had become timid, but he pushed himself
        into extreme situations of total dependence on God. And God does not let him down, but teaches him a lesson when he begins to feel safe.\n

        [92] "\u00B9"During that time in Venice, he busied himself giving the Exercises and in other spiritual contacts.
        "\u00B2"The most distinguished persons to whom he gave them were Master Pietro Contarini and Master Gaspar de Doctis, and a Spaniard whose name was Rozas.
        "\u00B3"There was also another Spaniard there called the bachelor Hoces, who was in close touch with the pilgrim and also with the bishop of Cette.
        "\u2074"Although he had some desire to make the Exercises, still he did not put it into execution.\n
        "\u2075"At last he decided to begin making them. And having made them for three or four days, he spoke
        his mind to the pilgrim, telling him that because of the things someone had told him, he had been afraid
        that he would be taught some evil doctrine in the Exercises. "\u2076"For this reason he had brought with him
        certain books so he could have recourse to them, if perchance he tried to deceive him. "\u2077"He was helped
        very much by the Exercises and in the end resolved to live the pilgrim’s way. "\u2078"He was also the first one
        to die.\n
        [93] "\u00B9"In Venice the pilgrim also endured another persecution, with many saying that his effigy had
        been burned in Spain and in Paris. "\u00B2"This business went so far that a trial was held and sentence was
        given in favor of the pilgrim.\n
        "\u00B3"The nine companions came to Venice at the beginning of ‘ 37 . There they separated to serve in
        various hospices. "\u2074"After two or three months, they all went to Rome to obtain the blessing for the
        journey to Jerusalem. "\u2075"The pilgrim did not go because of Doctor Ortiz and also because of the new
        Theatine cardinal. "\u2076"The companions returned from Rome with drafts for 200 or 300 escudos, which had
        been given to them as alms for the journey to Jerusalem. "\u2077"They did not want to take anything except in
        drafts; later, not being able to go to Jerusalem, they gave them back to the donors.\n
        "\u2078"The companions returned to Venice in the fashion they had gone, that is, on foot and begging, but
        divided into three groups and in such a way that they were always of different nationalities. "\u2079"There in
        Venice, those who were not ordained were ordained priests, and the Nuncio who was then in Venice
        (and who was later known as Cardinal Verallo) gave them faculties. "\u00B9""\u2070"They were ordained ad titulum
        paupertatis and all made vows of chastity and poverty.\n
        [94] "\u00B9"In that year no ships sailed for the East because the Venetians had broken off with the Turks. "\u00B2"So,
        seeing that their hope of sailing was put off, they dispersed within the Venetian region, with the
        intention of waiting the year they had decided upon; and if it expired without possibility of travel, they
        would go to Rome.\n
        "\u00B3"It fell to the pilgrim to go with Faber and Laínez to Vicenza. "\u2074"There they found a certain house
        outside the city, which had neither doors nor windows. They stayed in it, sleeping on a little straw that
        they had brought. "\u2075"Two of them always went out to seek alms in the city twice a day, but they got so
        little they could hardly maintain themselves. "\u2076"They usually ate a little toasted bread when they had it,
        and the one who remained at home saw to its toasting. "\u2077"In this way they spent forty days, not engaging
        in anything other than prayer.\n
        [95] "\u00B9"After the forty days, Master John Codure arrived; and the four together decided to begin to
        preach. The four went to different piazzas and began to preach on the same day and at the same hour,
        first shouting loudly and summoning people with their caps. "\u00B2"Their preaching caused a great stir in the
        city, and many persons were moved with devotion, and they received in greater abundance the material
        goods they needed.\n
        "\u00B3"During the time he was at Vicenza, he had many spiritual visions and many quite regular
        consolations; the contrary happened when he was in Paris. "\u2074"In all that traveling he had great
        supernatural experiences like those he used to have when he was in Manresa, especially when he began
        to prepare for the priesthood in Venice and when he was preparing to say Mass.\n
        "\u2075"While he was still at Vicenza, he learned that one of the companions, who was at Bassano, was ill
        to the point of death; at the same time he too was ill with fever. "\u2076"Nevertheless he set out and walked so
        vigorously that Faber, his companion, could not keep up with him. "\u2077"On that journey he had assurance
        from God, and he told Faber so, that the companion would not die of that illness. "\u2078"On their arriving at
        Bassano, the sick man was much comforted and soon recovered. "\u2079"Then they all returned to Vicenza;
        and all ten were there for some time, and some used to go seeking alms in the towns around Vicenza.\n
        [96] "\u00B9"Then, the year being over and no passage available, they decided to go to Rome—even the
        pilgrim, because on the other occasion when the companions had gone, those two about whom he had
        doubts had shown themselves very kind. "\u00B2"They went to Rome divided into three or four groups, the
        pilgrim with Faber and Laínez. On this journey he was visited very especially by God.\n
        "\u00B3"He had decided to spend a year without saying Mass after he became a priest, preparing himself
        and praying Our Lady to deign to place him with her Son. "\u2074"One day, a few miles before reaching
        Rome, he was at prayer in a church and experienced such a change in his soul and saw so clearly that
        God the Father placed him with Christ his Son that he would not dare doubt it—that God the Father
        had placed him with his Son. *\n
        [97] "\u00B9"Then on arriving in Rome he told the companions that he saw the windows were closed, meaning
        to say that they would have to meet many contradictions. "\u00B2"He also said, “We must be very much on our
        guard, and not have contacts with women, unless they are prominent.” "\u00B3"While on this subject, later in
        Rome Master Francis was confessor to a woman and sometimes visited her to treat of spiritual matters,
        and she was subsequently found to be pregnant; but the Lord deigned that the one who had done the
        mischief should be discovered. "\u2074"The same sort of thing happened to John Codure, with a spiritual

        suffering in the leg. "\u2074"He told me he would speak to me about the Constitutions in the evening.\n
        "\u2075"The same day he summoned me before supper, with the air of a person who was more recollected
        than usual, and made a sort of protestation to me, the sum of which was to show the intention, the
        sincerity with which he had related these things. He said he was quite sure he had not exaggerated;
        "\u2076"and that he had committed many offenses against Our Lord after he began to serve him, but that he
        had never consented to mortal sin. "\u2077"Rather, he had always grown in devotion, that is, ease in finding
        God; and now more than ever in his whole life. "\u2078"Every time, any hour, that he wished to find God, he
        found him. And even now he often had visions, especially those mentioned above in which he saw
        Christ as the sun. "\u2079"This often happened while he was engaged in important matters, and that gave him
        confirmation.\n
        [100] "\u00B9"He also had many visions when he said Mass; and when he was drawing up the Constitutions
        too, he had them very often. He can now affirm this more easily because every day he wrote down
        what went on in his soul and he had it now in writing. "\u00B2"He showed me a rather large bundle of writings,
        of which he read me a good bit. "\u00B3"Most were visions that he saw in confirmation of some of the
        Constitutions, at times seeing God the Father, at times all three Persons of the Trinity, at times Our
        Lady—who interceded and at times confirmed.\n
        "\u2074"In particular he spoke to me about precisions over which he spent forty days, saying Mass each
        day, and each day with many tears. The question was whether a church could have any fixed income
        and whether the Society should make use of that.\n
        [101] "\u00B9"The method which he followed while he was drafting the Constitutions was to say Mass each
        day and to present to God the point that he was treating, and to pray over it; he always had tears at
        prayer and Mass.\n
        "\u00B2"I wished to see all those papers on the Constitutions, and asked him to let me have them a while; he
        would not.\n

        [98] This chapter is made up of bits and pieces and the first section ends with a sigh of relief, leaving the rest of the story to Nadal.
        Then da Câmara takes up the narrative, speaking in the first person and providing some very interesting and useful information.\n
        Jerome Nadal was a native of Majorca, who first met Ignatius in Paris, but kept him at a distance.
        After a long and painful process of discernment he became a Jesuit in Rome, and soon came to be
        appreciated for his ability to assimilate and articulate the spirit of Ignatius, being appointed by him to
        promulgate and explain the experimental Constitutions to the nascent Society. He is still regarded as
        an authority on the Ignatian charism.\n
        [100] The bundle of notes was destroyed by Ignatius; but a fragment has survived, and is now known
        and much appreciated as the Spiritual Diary; it includes the discernment of forty days on poverty,
        which is mentioned later.\n
        [101] Ignatius did not undertake the writing of the Constitutions on his own but commissioned by the
        companions. They are almost entirely his work; but with the able assistance of his secretary, Juan
        Polanco, he researched and consulted assiduously, making improvements till his death in 1556, and
        leaving the final approval to the First General Congregation, which met in 1558 and adopted the text
        with minor changes.\n

        <string name="str_cons_foreword">
        <p>This foreword is meant to explain to the reader certain distinctive features of this complete English translation of the Jesuit
            Constitutions and their complementary norms.</p>\n\n
        <p>The annotated Constitutions and their norms are the expression of the
        revised legislation particular to the Society of Jesus as a religious order in
        the Church. In his preface to this volume, Very Reverend Peter-Hans
        Kolvenbach, superior general of the Society of Jesus, states the reasons for
        such a revision of the particular legislation of the Society of Jesus and the
        way in which it has been accomplished. At the conclusion of the work of
        revision mandated by the Thirty-fourth General Congregation, its results
        were published in an official Latin version. That volume, in accord with
        the decisions of the congregation, comprises two sections. First is presented
            the original Ignatian text of the Constitutions of the Society along
        with notes appended to it by authority of the congregation. Those notes
        indicate which parts of the Constitutions general Church law or decisions
        of general congregations of the Society have abrogated, modified, or clarified
            over the course of time. The second section of the Latin text contains
        the norms complementary to the Constitutions. They express both the
        spirit of the Constitutions and the appropriate way in which those
        Constitutions are to be lived out in the contemporary renewal of our life
        and our apostolates. By decision of the congregation, these two parts of
        our law were in the future to be published in one and the same volume,
        so that, as Father Kolvenbach says, the living internal unity that exists
        between these two parts of our law might shine forth more clearly.</p>\n\n

        <p>As a help toward displaying that internal unity, this English translation in CD-ROM form at places,
            sequentially, the texts of the ten parts of the Constitutions and of the
            ten parts of the Complementary Norms corresponding to them . (So that the reader may more easily distinguish
            the Constitutions from the Norms, the latter are set in a different typeface from that used for the Constitutions,
            and are surrounded by a frame.) The brief table of contents, beginning on page v, will provide a first comprehensive
            glimpse of how that has been accomplished .</p>\n\n

        <p>For ease of reference, the text of the Constitutions includes the customary
            sequential paragraph numbers included within brackets ([ ]). The
            text of the norms has its own such numbers, unbracketed , at the beginning of paragraphs.
            Within the text of the Constitutions there are two sets
            of superscript numbers. One such set of superscript numbers (this one bracketed ) always follows a
            sentence or clause and refers to the footnotes at the bottom of that page.
            The other set of superscript numbers (unbracketed ) are verse numbers, placed at the
            beginning of sentences or at the beginning of major clauses within a sentence.
            Over the last several years these verse numbers have commonly been
            applied to similar sentences and clauses in new editions of the works
            of Saint Ignatius and to new vernacular translations. This allows the
            reader to refer to a particular place in any one of the works using
            reference numbers identical in almost all other editions or translations.
            Several examples of publications employing these new verse numbers are
            Ecrits, a French collection of works of Saint Ignatius;
            The Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius: A Translation and
            Commentary, an American collection of such works; and An Ignatian
            Concordance (Concordancia Ignatiana), published by the Spanish publishers
            Mensajero/Sal Terrae in cooperation with the Institute of Jesuit Sources.
            (See p age 378 for examples of these two sets of numbers.)</p>\n\n

        <p>The preparation of this English translation has been an example of
        generous and wholehearted Jesuit collaboration. In this it imitates the
        way in which the original documents came into being. The delegates to
        the Thirty-first and Thirty-second General Congregations renewed the
        Societys law in accord with Vatican II. Members of the Jesuit Curia in
        Rome labored long and hard over many years to provide, in several preliminary
            drafts of annotated Constitutions and Complementary Norms, a formal structure for this renovation.
            Consultations with experts from around the world were part of this process.
            Province congregations convened before the Thirty-fourth General Congregation examined
            such drafts in detail. The members them selves of the Thirty-fourth
            Congregation in special commissions and in general sessions throughout
            the time of the congregation carefully considered every portion of the
            texts and their implications. After the final comprehensive vote on March
            18, 1995, that formally put these texts into place in the life of the Society,
            many members of the Curia once again labored with dedication over a
            period of many months to prepare the definitive and official Latin text.</p>\n\n

        <p>So, too, with this English-language volume. The basis for the English
        text of the Constitutions is the translation by George E. Ganss, S.J., originally
            published in 1971. This has been corrected , revised , and updated in
            the last several years, with a view to eventual publication, along with his
            commentary and cross-references, in the Institute of Jesuit Sources two
            volumes of collected writings of Saint Ignatius (currently in preparation).
            A first-draft English translation of the Complementary Norms was prepared by
            Carl J. Moell, S.J., at that time resident in Rome serving as the
            assistant procurator general of the Society. George Ganss, John McCarthy,
            Martin O Keefe, Martin Palmer, and Nicholas Pope, all members of the
            Society of Jesus associated with the Institute of Jesuit Sources, then
            entered into the lengthy and detailed preparation of this edition. They
            worked at everything from translating the comprehensive Latin index to
            scrutinizing and revising with editorial acumen each page of the translations
            of both Constitutions and Norms; from verifying footnotes to handcrafting virtually
            every page of the camera-ready copy; from proofreading the entire text to preparing
            for the worldwide distribution of copies of this volume. As director of the Institute
            of Jesuit Sources, I wish publicly to express to them my gratitude and , I am sure,
            the gratitude of whoever enjoys in this volume the results of their competence and generosity.
            It only remains now, as Pedro de Ribadeneira said in the preface of the first printed
            edition of the Constitutions, that all the members of the Society find in these texts
            the bonds that fasten and weld this whole body together to be a dwelling for the heavenly
            Spirit and the grace of God , which is the real life of any religious order,"
            so that our name will be matched by our lives and our profession made manifest in deed."</p>\n

        <string name="str_cons_foreword_footer_2">THE DATE 1558, AT THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE SEAL OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS USED AS AN ILLUSTRATION ON THE COVER OF THIS BOOK, MARKS THE YEAR IN WHICH THE FIRST GENERAL CONGREGATION WAS HELD. IT WAS THIS CONGREGATION THAT OFFICIALLY APPROVED THE JESUIT CONSTITUTIONS.</string>

        <string name="str_cons_preface">
        <p>1. General Congregation 33 (D. 6, 11, 2) mandated that when our own law was being brought into conformity with the
        requirements of the new universal law of the Church regarding religious institutes (namely,
        the 1983 Code of Canon Law for the Latin Church and the 1993 Code of Canon Law of the Eastern Churches)
        we should see to it that the prepara- tions for the complete revision of our own law,
        to be put into final form by the next general congregation, should be made with appropriate
        studious effort. For the Society had for sometime regarded such a revision of our law as desirable;
        and studies for getting it ready had already been undertaken some years prior to this at the
        urging and under the leadership of Reverend Father Pedro Arrupe,
            although he himself was not able to see these brought to a conclusion.</p>\n\n
        <p>2. Such a true and substantial renovation of its own law, required by
        the decree Perfectae Caritatis of Vatican Council II, and regulated by the
        moto proprio Ecclesiae Sanctae of Paul VI, the Society, for its part, had actually
            completed by means of General Congregations 31 (1965-66) and 32
        (1974-75), which thoroughly adapted the Societys life and apostolate to
        the new needs of the times, while at the same time retaining a genuine
        fidelity to its proper character and original mission. None the less, the
        Society had not yet been able to give a formal, normative structure to the
        many decrees embodying this renovation and accommodation. And thus
        the pressing need to undertake such a task without delay.</p>\n\n

        <p>3. After lengthy deliberation on the part of the Superior General with
            his consultors about the way for the Society to accomplish this revision
            most effectively, the following conclusions emerged :</p>\n\n

        <p>a. First of all, it seemed good to make every effort to see that the
        Constitutions of St. Ignatius, an explication of the Formula of the Institute
        of the Society of Jesus as approved by the supreme pontiffs Paul III (1540)
        and Julius III (1550) and a privileged expression of the found ational spiritual
            and apostolic experience of the first companions, should occupy a
        central and real place in our law and , through that law, should serve to
        inspire and govern our entire present day lives.
            Thus they had to be purged of elements that were obsolete or had been form ally abrogated;
        and it had to be determined which points in them had in the course of
        time been modified or authentically interpreted. This was to be done,
        however, with the help of notes that a general congregation authoritatively
            appended to the original Ignatian text, without making any changes in
        the latter. Thus it was hoped that the Constitutions could recover their
        basic and fundamental inspirational and normative force for the life of the
        Society, without turning out to be a document that was purely spiritual
        and doctrinal, tied to ages past, and consequently out of tune with the
        times.</p>\n\n

        <p>b. Those things that in the course of time had been decreed by
            subsequent general congregations and that seemed appropriate to retain
            in a modern renewal of our life and apostolate as a genuine and real
            expression of the spirit contained in the Constitutions should , once all
            unnecessary or obsolete elements had been removed , be reformulated
            and arranged according to the order of the Constitutions themselves, and
            should bear a permanent relationship to those Constitutions, as their
            "Complementary Norms," approved by a general congregation and alter able
            only by such a congregation.</p>\n\n

        <p>c. Finally, so that the living internal unity that exists between
        these two parts of our law might shine forth more clearly and their ongoing
            spiritual identity might be more obvious, the two were, in future, to
            be published in one and the same volume.</p>\n\n

        <p>The hope, surely, was that the Society could have available an instrument that
            would be at once legal and spiritual in character, authentically
                Ignatian, one that could help the Society "to proceed ever better in the
                path of the divine service, according to the nature of our Institute."</p>\n\n

        <p>4. This manner of proceeding all the provincials discussed at their
            congregation held in September 1990 at Loyola and approved by general
            consent, since experts had already prepared a sort of first draft of the project.</p>\n\n

        <p>5. Consultation was then undertaken with experts from the world-wide Society,
            nominated by the provincials, in regard to this first draft of
            the schema. Their discussions generated very many suggestions, which
            were made available to (and, indeed, provided considerable help to)
            those who were preparing the new draft. This latter, completed at the beginning
            of 1993, was sent to the provinces, so that their province congregations
            could examine it and could send to the general congregation postulata,
            as well as all manner of related suggestions about the project.</p>\n\n

        <p>6. Nearly all the provinces scrutinized the schema in one way or other
            and made known their thinking about it in a very positive fashion.
            They called for the completion of a revision along the lines of the proposed
            schema (albeit appropriately revised ), so that the general congregation
            could approve it. Many provinces, however, at the same time, sent along
            postulata and comments of great import and of great usefulness, which
            contributed to the fact that a Final Proposal, written by a special commission
            and incorporating clear improvements, could be offered for the consideration of the general congregation.</p>\n\n

        <p>7. The task of revising our own law deeply occupied General
            Congregation 34. For, on the one hand , it reserved certain points of the
            Final Proposal for its own discussion and decision, those that seemed of
            greater moment. On the other hand , each commission took on the part of
            the Final Proposal that it was to consider, along with the material related to it.
            Finally, a special commission was set up and made aware of all
            the suggestions that had occurred to everyone (commissions and individuals alike);
            it prepared the text to be voted upon, and over the space of an
            entire month proposed it to the congregation for a final vote piece by
            piece. On March 18 the congregation took a final comprehensive vote,
            with the greatest consensus and the greatest joy in the Spirit. It thus
            brought to a happy conclusion work stretching out over several years, in
            which, in diverse fashion, virtually the entire Society had taken part.</p>\n\n

        <p>8. Most gladly, then, my dearest brothers, do I now present to you our
            renewed Constitutions and their Complementary Norms, to be considered in your
            personal and communal prayer and to be observed in the spirit in which they have
            been written. Thus, with the help of God , may
            these, as Master Ignatius proposed , be a certain path to him in our
            enthusiastic following out of our mission in the Church, as servants of
            the mission of Christ under the leadership of the Roman Pontiff, for the
            greater praise and glory of Christ and for the good, the salvation, and the
            consolation of our fellow men and women, to whom we are sent in any
            region of the world whatsoever.</p>\n\n

        <p>Here "\u00B9" at last, beloved brothers in Christ Jesus, is what we have
        all been so eagerly longing and praying for our Societys Constitutions promulgated in their final form.
        Their appearance has been delayed longer than we had wished, but the reasons for this were both compelling and weighty;
        namely, that they might be drawn up with maturer deliberation and with greater devotion and care and,
        by being subjected to more prolonged trials, receive a form that would be more solid and enduring.</p>\n\n

        <p>In the Apostolic Sees letters establishing and confirming the Society,
            authorization had been granted to enact Constitutions on the understanding
            that once enacted and approved by the Society they would automatically
            be considered as approved and confirmed by the authority of the
            Apostolic See. "\u00B2" The Society was at that time scattered over the world and
            occupied with activities of great importance for faith and religion. Hence,
            it quite rightly entrusted its originator and found er, our Father Ignatius
            of holy memory, residing in Rome, with the task of writing and enacting the Constitutions.</p>\n\n

        <p>Carefully, wisely, and religiously did he undertake and carry out this
            task that had been laid upon him , to the extent that he made it his chief
            concern for a number of years. With many tears, ardent prayers, and
            repeated Sacrifices of the Mass, he implored from the Lord the anointing
            of the Holy Spirit, so that by the latters inspiration and guid ance he
            might accomplish through divine assistance what was impossible
            through human prudence. In this way, with immense toil he drew up
            the Constitutions with all their parts and brought them to completion.</p>\n\n

            because, as Francesco Sacchini writes in his History of the Society of Jesus (Part 2,
            book 2, no. 50 [p . 48]), some considered that nothing should be added to the
            Constitutions except what Ignatius had written himself. But because a variety of
            introductory or additional material had to be appended in later editions of the
            Constitutions, there seems to be no objection now to restoring to its original place
            this outstanding document, approved by the first fathers. The text is taken from

        was to have everywhere a single hue and form, "\u00B3" its Constitutions would
        have to be in the greatest possible agreement with all the practices of
        the provinces everywhere so as to enjoy permanent acceptance. Moreover,
        his estimation of himself was not so high that he was willing to rely
        in a matter of this magnitude exclusively upon his own way of
        proceeding or his own opinion and judgment.</p>\n\n

        <p>Accordingly, during the Jubilee Year of 1550, he showed the Constitutions
            he had written to nearly all the surviving professed Fathers (who
            had come to Rome), and solicited their criticisms. Taking all these comments into account,
            along with various other points which had been
            turned up by day-to-day experience, he finally sent the Constitutions to
            Spain in 1553 for promulgation there. He also sent them to a limited number
            of other places, his intention being to test grad ually how well the
            Constitutions meshed with the customs of all the provinces, and thus
            obtain the confirm ation of experience for what had been originally established by reason.</p>\n\n

        <p>All this would have been more than enough to ensure a reverent
            reception for the Constitutions. Nevertheless, in order to root them even
            more deeply in our spirits, a final hand was put to them by the general
            congregation last year, 1558, when the entire Society gathered in Rome to
            elect a superior general to succeed our departed Father Ignatius. After solemnization of the election,
            the Constitutions, which had been submitted for exam ination to the judgment
            of the entire general congregation, were received by it with great
            veneration and confirmed with unanimous enthusiasm.</p>\n\n

        <p>The text of the Constitutions approved at that time was a copy of the
            autograph written by our Father Ignatius. Since this was in Spanish, the
            congregation commissioned the newly elected Father General, along
            with several others judged competent for the task, to examine the Latin
            version which had been prepared . "\u2074" They compared it carefully with the
            Spanish original. While not aiming at a word-for-word translation, their
            concern for an exact rendering of the ideas was such that they decided ,
            especially in some passages, not to worry too much about idiomatic and
            elegant Latinity, but rather, following the ancient and approved practice
            of all the crafts, to try to express in our own special terminology the elements that are special to our order.</p>\n\n

        <p>In addition, His Lord ship Paul IV, by divine providence pope, submitted our Constitutions for examination
        to two most reverend cardinals, who returned them to us untouched , with not a word changed.
        "\u2075" Later, His Holiness gave his apostolic blessing not just to the congregation there present
        but to the entire body of the Society throughout the world, reconfirming and establishing
            by his apostolic authority all the favors, privileges, and indults granted us by his predecessors.⁶</p>\n\n

        <p>In view of all this, beloved brothers in Christ, we have no hesitation
            in presenting and publishing these Constitutions for your observance,
            backed as they are by such extensive deliberation and consensus. By
            authority of the most reverend vicar for Rome and of the master of the
            Sacred Palace, who have been placed in charge of the printing of books by
            the Supreme Pontiff, we present the Constitutions to you in printed form,
            thus obviating both the tiresome labor of making numerous copies by
            hand and the danger of errors creeping into such hand-copied texts. In
            this way we can ensure that the Constitutions reach you with greater ease
            and in a more correct form .</p>\n\n

        <p>What need is there, brothers, for me to spur on and encourage men
            like yourselves already running of your own accord at full speed to
            the eager, perfect, and entire observance of these Constitutions? The grace
            of our vocation itself and our God-given decision to lead a holy life ought
            to be weighty motives once we have grasped the character of our profession
            and embraced it with our whole hearts for proceeding to bend
            every effort and exertion towards fulfilling what we have received and
            corresponding to the heavenly grace of our vocation.</p>\n\n

        <p>This grace is set forth in the Formula of our Institute contained in the
            letters of the Apostolic See. There, however, our vocation and Institute are
            described in a global rather than detailed fashion. That is why it was
            deemed necessary to frame Constitutions that would give a fuller and
            more particularized treatment of various matters. These Constitutions
            contain our Societys sinews, our orders supporting walls, the bonds that</p>\n\n

        <p>fasten and weld this whole body together to be a dwelling for the heavenly Spirit and the grace of God, which is the real life
            of any religious order.</p>\n\n
        <p>Here we shall find the pattern we are to imitate, the way we are to
            pursue, the light we are to follow, the perfection towards which we are to
            aspire. Here we shall find the mirror in which to inspect our own lives.
            Beholding in the Constitutions the finished portrait of all virtue and perfection,
            each of us should do his best to present a living expression of it in his own holy manner of life.</p>\n\n
        <p>Here each of us should eagerly seek out whatever applies to his own
            formation and to the fulfillm ent of the duties of his particular state.</p>\n\n

        <p>Here superiors ought to seek directives on how they should be an
            example to others; how they should govern those under them with conscientiousness and concern;
            how they should test the novices, educate the
            unlearned , strengthen the weak, and exercise the robust in sum , how by
            their word and example they should lead all forward to perfection.</p>\n\n

        <p>Here subjects should learn how to revere their superiors, loving them
            as fathers, respecting them as teachers, obeying them eagerly, trusting
            their advice, heeding their admonitions, and seeing in them Christ himself
            as the one who commands.</p>\n\n

        <p>Here teachers should learn what disciplines to impart and what
            methods to use, and also what exercises to employ in strengthening their
            students minds and forming them in virtue no less than in letters.</p>\n\n

        <p>Here scholastics should learn to know the purpose of their studies,
            and how they should keep their work from overwhelming or cooling their
            fervor of spirit by learning how to couple prayer with study, piety with
            learning, heartfelt movement of the will with reflection in the mind .</p>\n\n

        <p>What shall I say of our temporal coadjutors? Are they not also portrayed
            in the Constitutions men of good conscience, peaceful, cooperative,
            lovers of perfection and given to devotion, happy with Martha\'s part?</p>\n\n

        <p>The spiritual coadjutors, for their part, should be eager for all virtue
            as well as hard working, steady, and afire with zeal for the salvation of souls.</p>\n\n

        <p>The professed, who stand first in order and rank, should also excel by
            their example and heavenly manner of life. They should be like men marked
            out for death, ready, at the slightest bidding of the Supreme
            Pontiff and Vicar of Christ, to whom they have bound them selves by a
            special vow, to set off joyfully to preach Christ anywhere on earth,
            whether among pagans, Turks, or Indians, whether among believers or
            unbelievers. They should hold it a great privilege as indeed it is to
            pour out their blood , along with this momentary life, so that they might
            rejoice forever in immortality.</p>\n\n

        <p>Finally, the Constitutions train us all for perfection, instructing us in
            the weapons to be used in combatting our three fierce and raging adversaries.
            They teach us how to counter the lust of the flesh with chastity, the
            lust of the eyes with poverty, and the pride of life with obedience. I shall
            say nothing of our observance of chastity (in which we should imitate the
            purity of the angels so far as our frailty allows), or of our observance of
            poverty (which is so strict that neither churches nor professed houses may
            acquire any rents, lands, or even perpetual endowments). As for obedience,
            however, by which we consecrate the chief and noblest part of ourselves to God,
            our Constitutions require of us that it be so prompt, eager,
            perfect, and integral that we do not swerve even a hairsbreadth from our
            superiors commands. In matters falling under obedience, not only must
            our action be guided by the superiors command and our will by his w ill,
            bu t even something much more difficult our understanding by his understanding.</p>\n\n

        <p>To sum up: men crucified to the world , and to whom the world itself
            is crucified "\u2077" such would our Constitutions have us to be; new men, I
            say, who have put off their affections to put on Christ; "\u2078" dead to themselves
            to live to justice; who, with St. Paul in labors, in watchings, in fastings,
            in chastity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in sweetness, in the Holy
            Spirit, in charity unfeigned , in the word of truth, show themselves ministers of God
            "\u2079" and by the arm or of Justice on the right hand and , on the
            left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report, by good success finally
            and ill success, press forward with great strides to their heavenly country.
            This is the sum and aim of our institute.</p>\n\n

        <p>And so I beseech you , brothers in the Lord , that we may walk in a
            manner worthy of our vocation, "\u00B9""\u2070" and , in order to know that vocation,
            may read and reread these Constitutions that have been bestowed upon
            us by the gift of God. Let us study them day and night. Let us vie with
            each other in learning them, pondering them, and keeping them. If we do
            so, our name will be matched by our lives and our profession made manifest in deed .</p>\n\n

        <string name="str_cons_formula_of_the_institute_cont_1">
        <p>Taken from the apostolic letter Regimini militantis Ecclesiae, dated September 27, 1540.
            As expressed there, the Formula describing the Institute of lgnatius and his companions reads as follows:
        </p>\n
    </string>

        <string name="str_cons_formula_of_the_institute_cont_2">
        <p>1.¹ Whoever wishes to serve as a soldier of God beneath the banner of the cross in our Society,
            which we desire to be designated by the name of Jesus, and to serve the Lord alone and his vicar on earth,
            should keep in mind that once he has made a solemn vow of perpetual chastity he is a member of a
            community founded chiefly for this purpose: "\u00B2" to strive especially for the progress of souls in
            Christian life and doctrine and for the propagation of the faith by the ministry of the word ,
            by spiritual exercises and works of charity, and specifically by the education of children and unlettered persons in Christianity.
            "\u00B3" He should further take care to keep always before his eyes first God, and the nature of this Institute which is his pathway
            to God; and let him strive with all his effort to achieve this end set before him by God "\u2074" each one,
            however, according to the grace which the Holy Spirit has given to him and according to the particular grade of his own vocation, lest
            anyone should perhaps show zeal, but a zeal which is not according to knowledge.</p>\n\n

        <p>2 "\u2075" The selection of each ones grade as well as the entire distribution of employments shall be in
            the power of the superior or prelate who is to be elected by us, so that the proper order necessary
            in every well-organized community may be preserved . "\u2076" This superior, with the advice of his associates,
            shall possess in the council, where the majority of votes always has the right to prevail, the authority
            to establish constitutions leading to the achievement of this end which we have set for ourselves.
            "\u2077"In matters that are more serious and lasting, the council should be understood to be the greater part
            of the whole Society which can conveniently be summoned by the superior; but in matters less important and
            more temporary it will be all those who happen to be present in the place where our superior will reside.
            "\u2078"All right to execute and command , however, will be in the power of the superior.</p>\n\n

        <p>3 "\u00B9" All the members should know not only when they make their first profession but daily, as long
            as they live, that this entire Society and each one individually are
            campaigning for God under [the pope] and the other Roman Pontiffs who will succeed him.
            And although the Gospel teaches us, we know from orthodox faith, and we firmly profess that all the
            faithful in Christ are subject to the Roman Pontiff as to their head and the vicar of Jesus Christ, still, for
            the greater humility of our Society and the perfect mortification of each one of us and the abnegation of our own wills, we have judged
            that it is of the greatest profit to us to go beyond the ordinary obligations and bind ourselves by a special vow, so that whatever the
            present Roman Pontiff and others to come will wish to command us with regard to the progress of souls and the propagation of the
            faith, or wherever he may be pleased to send us to any regions whatsoever, we will obey at once, without subterfuge or excuse, as
            far as in us lies. We pledge to do this whether he sends us among the Turks or to other infidels, even to the land they call India, or to
            any heretics or schismatics, or to any of the faithful.</p>\n\n

        <p>4 "\u2074"Therefore, those who will come to us should , before they
            take this burden upon their shoulders, ponder long and seriously, as the Lord has counseled, whether
            they possess among their resources enough spiritual capital to complete this tower; "\u2075"that is,
            whether the Holy Spirit who moves them is offering them so much grace that with his aid they
            have hope of bearing the weight of this vocation. "\u2076" Then, after they have enlisted through
            the inspiration of the Lord in this militia of Christ, they ought to be prompt in carrying out this obligation which
            is so great, being clad for battle day and night.</p>\n\n

        <p>5 "\u2077"However, to forestall among us any ambition for such missions or provinces, or any refusal of them,
            let each one promise never to carry on negotiations with the Roman pontiff about such missions directly
            or indirectly, but to leave all this care to God and to his vicar and to the superior of the Society.
            "\u2078"This superior, too, just like the rest, shall also promise not to approach the pontiff in one way or another
            about being sent on some mission, except with the advice of the Society.</p>\n\n

        <p>6 "\u00B9"All should likewise vow that in all matters that concern the observance of this Rule they will obey the
            superior of the Society. "\u00B2"The superior, however, should issue the commands which he knows to be opportune
            for achieving the end set before him by God and by the Society. In his superiorship he should be ever mindful of the
            kindness, meekness, and charity of Christ and of the pattern set by Peter and Paul, "\u00B3"a norm which
            both he and the council should keep constantly in view. Particularly let them hold in esteem the instruction of children
            and the unlettered in the Christian doctrine of the Ten Commandments and other similar elementary principles, whatever will
            seem suitable to them in accordance with the circumstances of persons, places, and times. "\u2074"For it
            is very necessary that the superior and the council watch this ministry with diligent attention, since
            the edifice of faith cannot arise among our fellow men without a foundation, and also since in our own members there is danger that
            as one becomes more learned he may tend to decline this occupation, less prestigious at first glance,
            "\u2075"although no other is in fact more fruitful either for the edification of the neighbor or for the exercise by our own members
            of activities that combine both humility and charity. Assuredly, too, both because of the great value of good order and for
            the sake of the constant practice of humility (never sufficiently praised ), the subjects should always be obliged to obey
            the superior in all matters pertaining to the Societys Institute, and to recognize and properly venerate Christ as present in him .</p>\n\n

        <p>7 "\u00B9"From experience we have learned that a life removed as far as possible from all contagion of a varice and as like as possible to
            evangelical poverty is more gratifying, more undefiled , and more suitable for the edification of our neighbors. We likewise know that our Lord Jesu s Christ w ill sup ply
            to his servants who are seeking only the kingdom of God what is necessary for food and clothing.
            "\u00B2"Therefore one and all should vow perpetual poverty, declaring that they cannot, either individually or in common, acquire any civil right
            to any stable goods or to any annually recurring produce or fixed income for the sustenance or use of the Society. Rather, let them
            be content with only the use of necessary things, when the owners permit it, and to receive money and the sale price of things given
            them that they may buy what is necessary for themselves.</p>\n\n

        <p>8 "\u00B3"They may, however, set up a college or colleges in universities capable of having fixed revenues, annuities, or possessions which
            are to be applied to the uses and needs of students. "\u2077"The general or the Society retains the full government or superintendency over the
            aforementioned colleges and students; "\u2078"and this pertains to the choice of the rectors or governors and of the scholastics; the admission,
            dismissal, reception, and exclusion of the same; the enactment of statutes; the arrangement, instruction , edification , and correction of the scholastics;
            the manner of supplying them with food , clothing, and all the other necessary materials; and every other kind of government, control, and care.
            "\u2079"All this should be managed in such a way that neither may the students be able to abuse the aforementioned goods nor may the professed Society
            be able to convert them to its own uses, but may use them to provide for the needs of the scholastics.
            "\u00B9""\u2070"At length, after their progress in spirit and learning has become manifest and after sufficient testing, they can be admitted into our
            Society. "\u00B9""\u00B9"All those who are in holy orders, even though they can acquire no right to benefices and fixed revenues, should nonetheless
            be obliged to recite the office according to the rite of the Church.</p>\n\n

        <p>9 "\u00B9"These are the matters which we have been able to explain about our profession in a kind of sketch, which we are now doing that by
                this written document we may give succinct information, both to those who are asking us about our Rule of Life and also to those who
                will later on follow us if, God willing, we shall ever have imitators along this path.
                "\u00B2"By experience we have learned that the path has many and great difficulties connected with it, so we have considered it appropriate
                to prescribe that no one should be received into this Society who has not been carefully tested and shown himself prudent in Christ and noteworthy
                for either his learning or the purity of his Christian life. Only in this case should he be admitted into the militia of Jesus Christ.
                May Christ deign to be favorable to these our tender beginnings, to the glory of God the Father, to whom alone be glory and honor forever. Amen.</p>\n\n

        after a solemn vow of perpetual chastity, poverty, and obedience, keep what follows in mind. He is a member of a Society

        "\u00B2"to strive especially for the defense and propagation of the faith and for the progress of

            to His Holiness Pope Paul III and his successors in the Roman pontificate.
            "\u00B2"And although we are taught by the Gospel, and we know from the orthodox faith, and we firmly profess that all of Christs faithful
            are subject to the Roman pontiff as their head and as the vicar of Jesus Christ,

            the present and future Roman pontiffs may order which pertains to the progress of souls and the propagation of the faith; and to go
            at once,

            "\u2076"that is, whether the Holy Spirit who moves them is offering them so much grace that with his aid they have hope of bearing the
            weight of this vocation.
            "\u2077"Then, after they have enlisted through the inspiration of the Lord in this militia of Christ, they ought to be prompt in carrying out this

            understanding: They should not either by themselves or through someone else carry on negotiations with the Roman pontiff about such missions,
            but leave all this care to God , and to the pope himself as his vicar, and to the superior general of the Society.
            "\u2079"Indeed , this general too, just like the rest, should not treat with the said pontiff about his being sent or not,
            unless after advice from the Society.

        <p>6 "\u00B9""\u2070"All should likewise vow that in all matters which pertain to the observance of this Rule they will be obedient to the one put

            in the Constitutions.)
            "\u00B9""\u00B9"Moreover, he should possess all the authority and power over the Society which are useful for its good administration, correction,
            and government. He should issue the commands which he knows to be opportune for achieving the end set before him by God
            and the Society. In his superiorship he should be ever mindful of the kindness, meekness, and charity of Christ and of the pattern set by
            Peter and Paul, a norm which both he and the aforementioned council should keep constantly in view.
            "\u00B2"Assuredly, too, because of the immense value of good order and for the sake of the constant practice of humility, never sufficiently
            praised , the individual subjects should not only be obliged to obey the general in all matters pertaining to the Societys Institute but

            endowed (but not from resources which it pertains to the Holy See to apply), they may be established through authorization from the Holy See

            "\u2076"These colleges should be capable of having fixed revenues, annuities, or possessions which are to be applied to the uses and needs of
            the students.
            "\u2077"The general or the Society retains the full government or superintendency over the aforementioned colleges and students;

            has become manifest and after sufficient testing, they can be admitted into our Society.

            so that if anything is subtracted in this regard in accordance with each ones need or desire of spiritual progress, it may be offered ,

            who ask us about our plan of life and also to those who will later follow us if, God willing, we shall ever have imitators along this path.
            "\u2074"By experience we have learned that the path has many and great difficulties connected with it. Consequently we have judged it opportune to
            decree that no one should be permitted to pronounce his profession in this Society unless his life and doctrine have been probed by long and
            exacting tests (as will be explained in the Constitutions).
            "\u2075"For in all truth this Institute requires men who are thoroughly humble and prudent in Christ as well as conspicuous in the integrity of
            Christian life and learning.
            "\u2076"Moreover, some persons will be admitted to become coad jutors either for spiritual or temporal concerns or to become scholastics.
            After sufficient probations and the time specified in the Constitutions, these too should , for their greater devotion and merit, pronounce
            their vows. But their vows will not be solemn "\u2077"(except in the case of some who with permission from the superior general will be able to
            make three solemn vows of this kind because of their devotion and personal worth).
            "\u2078"Instead , they will be vows by which these persons are bound as long as the superior general thinks that they should be retained in the Society,
            as will be explained more fully in the Constitutions. But these coad jutors and scholastics too should be admitted into this militia of Jesus Christ
            only after they have been diligently examined and found suitable for that same end of the Society.

            disposition or determination either of the universal law of the Church or of some general congregation.\n
            3. The text itself of the Constitutions is preserved unchanged. However, as indicated above, those passages that have subsequently been

            of the cross and serving the Lord alone and the Church his spouse under the Roman Pontiff, the vicar of Christ on earth,"\u00B3" they would be sent

            §2. But if this genuine image of the Society cannot be perfectly converted into normative expressions, these Norms must always be referred back
            to this image as expressed in the Formula of the Institute and in the Constitutions. For this image is the primary pattern, whose outline the present

            144 §1. By the vow of chastity, we devote ourselves to the Lord and to his service in such a unique love
            that it excludes marriage and any other exclusive human relationship, as well as the genital expression
            and gratification of sexuality. Thus the vow entails the obligation of complete continence in celibacy for the
            sake of the kingdom of heaven. Following the evangelical counsel of chastity, we aspire to deepen our
            familiarity with God, our configuration to Christ, our companionship with our brother Jesuits, our service to
            our neighbors whoever they may be; and at the same time we aspire to grow in our personal maturity and
            capacity to love.["\u00B3"]
        </p>\n
        <p>
            §2. Hence in the Society chastity, which is before all else God\'s gracious gift, ["\u2074"] is essentially apostolic
            and the source of radical availability and mobility for mission, ["\u2075"] and not at all to be understood as directed
            exclusively to our own personal sanctification. Its precious apostolic fruitfulness, besides providing freedom
            for greater mobility in God\'s service, in imitation of the angels, ["\u2076"] is a mature, simple, anxiety-free dealing with
            the men and women with whom and for whom we exercise our ministry for building up the body of Christ.["\u2077"]

        <p>
            §3. Especially in our times, when people tend to put whole classes of their fellow human beings
            beyond the margins of their concern, while at the same time identifying love with eroticism, the self-denying love that is warmly human,
            yet freely given in service to all, especially to the poor and the marginalized, can be a powerful sign leading people to Christ,

        <p>
            145 This consecration of ourselves to Christ involves a certain affective renunciation and solitude of heart;
            namely, a renunciation of conjugal intimacy and the possibility of having children of one s own; and of an
            affective bonding that is a normal condition for achieving human growth and establishing a family of
            one\'s own. But this is part of the cross offered to us by Jesus Christ as we follow his footsteps, and closely associates
            us with his paschal mystery and makes us sharers of the spiritual fruitfulness that flows from it. But not only does it not
            diminish our personality or hamper human contacts and dialogue, it expands affectivity instead, assists people fraternally, and
            brings them to a fuller charity.["\u2079"]
        </p>\n\n
        <p>
            146 §1. That the love once consecrated by chastity may grow unceasingly, all should before all else cultivate intimate familiarity with God
            and friendship with Christ through contemplation of his mysteries and through life-giving assimilation to him in the sacraments both of
            penance and of the Eucharist.["\u00B9""\u2070"]

        <p>
            §2. It is also very important, as the Society has learned from the experience of Ignatius himself,["\u00B9""\u00B9"] to
            renew incessantly the strong desire of persevering, by means of humble and simple devotion to the Blessed
            Virgin Mary, who by her chaste assent obtained divine fecundity and became the mother of fair love.["\u00B9""\u00B2"]
        </p>\n
        <p>
            §3. Chastity is more safely preserved "when in common life true fraternal love thrives among its
            members," by fostering charity and the ready union of souls, which disposes us to bear one another\'s burdens;
            and when we feel a generous love for one

            recourse to a higher superior, other persons some of whom may be from outside the Society may be invited by mutual consent to assist in forming
            the individual\'s conscience more clearly. This should be done privately and without publicity.
        </p>\n
        <p>
            4° This procedure cannot be imposed on either the superior or the member. It is entirely voluntary and unofficial,
            and is nothing more than a new effort to find the divine will. The opinion of those consulted has no juridical effect on the authority of the
            superior. It is merely advisory.

            5° If, after following this procedure, the member still feels he cannot obey in good conscience,

            177 The dictum in our Institute that the manner of life in the Society should be common and not unlike the life of good priests in the same locality

            themselves and their families. In this regard, those who have influential and well-salaried positions must be especially alert. If we must undertake
            travels or use equipment exceeding such limits, these must really be, and as far as possible should clearly be seen to be, means necessary for our

        </p>\n

            1° Since the purpose of a manifestation of the defects of others to the superior is both the common good and the spiritual progress of individuals,

            person reveals about himself to another in an account of conscience or in secret or for the sake of seeking advice, so that he might be directed or
            helped; nor need Ours wait until they are asked by the superior.

        <p>
            3° Each one not only can but should manifest to the superior as to a father matters about to cause serious harm to the common good or imminent
            danger to some third party, so that he may secretly and prudently provide for both the good of the subject involved and for religious life in general.
        </p>\n
        <p>
            4° The manifestation should be made to the immediate superior unless serious reasons suggest that it should be made to the mediate one, in
            which case these reasons are to be made known to the latter.["\u00B9""\u2078""\u2075"]

            spiritual affairs in question, taking into account the need and the fruit reaped or anticipated; "\u00B2" and on the other by consideration of what
            occasions emerge elsewhere, what obligation there is to respond to them, and what resources the Society possesses to provide for this or

            whatever may be his title, to whom he habitually delegates responsibility for directing the institute or apostolic work. Such delegated vice-superiors
            or directors of the work are immediately dependent on the one appointed as the superior, and should give him an account of the office entrusted to him.

            dependent on the provincial in carrying out his function, with due observance of any existing civil regulations. This can also be the case when an

            forward what he deigned to begin for his service and praise and for the aid of souls. "\u2074" In conformity with this hope, the first and most
            appropriate means will be the prayers and Masses which ought to be offered for this holy intention, and which should be ordered for this purpose
            every week, month, and year in all places where the Society resides.

            of the objective it seeks, which is to aid souls to reach their ultimate and supernatural end, "\u00B2" the means which unite the human instrument
            with God and so dispose it that it may be wielded well by his divine hand "\u00B3" are more effective than those which equip it in relation to human
            beings. "\u2074" Such means are, for example, goodness and virtue, and especially charity, and a pure intention of the divine service, and familiarity
            with God our Lord in spiritual exercises of devotion, "\u2075" and sincere zeal for souls for the sake of the glory of the one who created and redeemed
            them and not for any other benefit. "\u2076" Thus it appears that care should be taken in general that all the members of the Society devote themselves
            to the solid and perfect virtues and to spiritual pursuits, and attach greater importance to them than to learning and other natural and hum an gifts.
            "\u2077" For these interior gifts are necessary to make those exterior means efficacious for the end which is being sought.

            the divine service alone; employed, indeed, not so that we may put our confidence in them, but so that we may cooperate with the divine grace
            "\u00B3" according to the arrangement of the sovereign providence of God our Lord. For he desires to be glorified both through the natural means,
            which he gives as Creator, and through the supernatural means, which he gives as the Author of grace. "\u2074" Therefore the human or acquired means
            ought to be sought with diligence, especially well-grounded and solid learning, and a method of proposing it to the people by means of sermons,
            lectures, and the art of dealing and conversing with others.

            those who possess the talent for it may receive in the colleges formation in Christian life and learning. For these colleges will be a seedbed for the
            professed Society and its coad jutors. "\u2074" Furthermore, if universities over which the Society exercises superintendency are added to the colleges,
            they too will aid toward the same end, as long as the manner of procedure described in Part IV [440-509] is preserved.

            for the preservation and growth of this whole body that every appearance of avarice should be banished afar, through the Society\'s <b>abstention from

        <p>A young Spanish Jesuit is missioned to Japan, where he experiences events that will affect the rest of his life.</p>\n\n

        <p>The animated short film “Arrupe in Japan” is a collaboration between the Jesuit Conference of Asia Pacific, the Digital Arts and Computer Animation Department of the Ateneo de Naga University in Naga, Philippines, and Elisabeth University of Music in Hiroshima, Japan. It takes a look at the early years of Fr Pedro Arrupe SJ, former Jesuit Superior General, when he was a young man in pre-World War II Japan. In 1945, when he was the Master of Novices in Nagatsuka, a mere six kilometres outside of Hiroshima, he experienced the onslaught of the atomic bomb dropped by an American warplane over the city. With his medical knowledge, Fr Arrupe helped victims who flocked to their house. One young man whose wounds were treated by Fr Arrupe would survive his injuries and later become a priest himself.</p>\n\n

        <p>Today, 78 years after the bombing of Hiroshima, Fr Arrupe’s light shines ever brighter. His words about being men and women for others still resonate five decades after he shared them in Valencia, Spain, when he addressed a gathering of Jesuit alumni. Fr Arrupe was certainly himself a man for others—not only in Japan, where he was side by side with the Japanese people during one of the most difficult moments of history—but also throughout his entire life.</p>\n\n
